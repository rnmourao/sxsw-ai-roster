1759|Conversational Design Sprint|0.005|0.005|0.0|0|Westin Austin Downtown The Gallery Room|310 E 5th ST. Austin, TX, EUA|10|11:00:00|13:00:00|30.2666201|-97.7403752|Advance RSVP is available to Primary Entry badge types only. Walk-ups may be accepted on a first come, first served basis. Great actions are a conversation. Conversational, natural language, interfaces are emerging as a powerful new way for people to interact with digital services. In order to design a natural user interface, we need to apply a human-centered design approach. Research by Stanford professor Clifford Nass shows that people converse with computers in much the same way as they do with humans. They are most successful when the interface is natural and conversational.  There’s a process for creating conversations. The Conversation Design Sprint teaches that process. This hands-on design sprint shows how to design and prototype a conversational experience using new Google Design Sprint methodologies. It presents the theory and principles of social interaction, crafting the personality and dialog of the conversational agent, the rapid prototyping of the conversation, and exploring how the conversation changes when it’s manifested on multimodal surfaces such as mobile and wearables.

The intersection of physical and digital products is exploding with opportunities, and designers today are expected to think beyond the screen to build rich experiences. One way to achieve this is by creating prototypes with both physical and digital interactions.  This workshop will introduce designers to prototyping for the Internet of Things (IoT) using Arduino, an open-source electronics platform. Kathryn will walk through examples of multi-modal prototyping from low to high fidelity, sharing her physical examples in person and digging into the research insights discovered through testing them. Attendees will then get their hands dirty by building their own circuit, with provided Arduinos, and learn just how easy it is to create interesting interactions with a few lines of code.

As technology becomes more pervasive in our style choices, how can we think beyond simple customization or apps to truly own outward identity? In this workshop we will examine how artists and innovators are thinking beyond consumer wearables to larger identity issues that can be addressed by our choice of apparel and accessories. We will explore the ways the design community is expanding, hacking, and creating through open source technology. When the fashion and technology industries begin to collaborate, what opportunities do these open platforms create for the future of self expression?

Whether we're designing in-house, at an agency, or consulting, dynamics across interdisciplinary teams are more complex than ever. Without intentional focus and maintenance, a healthy relationship between collaborators gives way to miscommunication and roadblocks. So, when was the last time you checked the pulse of your team's culture? Every team forms a culture, whether it's healthy, disengaged, or straight up toxic. When designing in a bubble isn't an option, we need to cultivate a vulnerable work environment to build trust and align around common goals. In this workshop, you'll gain tools to empower your team to take ownership of its culture. Come learn to assess cultural health, identify ingrained patterns, and strategize better ways to work together. Leave this workshop ready to lead your design team to interdisciplinary harmony, with the outcomes to prove it.

We've evolved over millions of years to be a brilliantly social, visually guided, ecologically connected and imaginative species. The powerful levers that determine success of our efforts hinge on understanding and facilitating our evolved traits as human beings as well as learning from the millions of species that evolved alongside us. Biophilia speaks to the desires in every person to find complexity, refuge, mystery and delight in the environment to be part of a living ecosystem. Biomimicry is the practice of learning the tips and tricks from the natural world that have evolved over millions or billions of years, harnessing that genius and applying it to our own needs.
