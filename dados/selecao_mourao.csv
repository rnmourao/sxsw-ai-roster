Estimates are that 5% of us bet regularly creating an industry with revenues up to $400bn. But since 1992 sports betting was ILLEGAL in most states of the USA.  In May 2018 SCOTUS changed all that and said states can decide for themselves if sports betting is allowed. States have reacted quickly with 8 states legalising betting and 15 more in the process of regulating. Regulated, and transparent, betting will reveal previously hidden scandals. The money coming in will change how we consume and engage with sports. The media and advertising landscape will dramatically alter to the demands of sports betting. Sports will be more entertaining. Legalised betting will change professional and college sports nationwide forever. This panel will discuss all this.Programming descriptions are generated by participants and do not necessarily reflect the opinions of SXSW.|60

Austin, TX, EUA|8|17:00:00|18:00:00|30.2620456|-97.7381328|Hackers may fascinate and terrify us, but they might be the immune system of our digital society. While dependence on connected technology has grown faster than our ability to secure it, friendly hackers improve public safety, public policy, and save lives - through security research. Yet media portrayals of hackers lack authenticity and fidelity, focused on harmful behavior and motivations, instead of diverse narratives in the real hacker community. Hacking is a superpower: for good or for ill. Better media role models will create the hacker heroes we need. Real world hackers team with fictional counterparts to examine hacker roles in society vs media. The audience will understand who hackers really are, who they can be, and what drives them - and will distinguish myth from reality.Programming descriptions are generated by participants and do not necessarily reflect the opinions of SXSW.|60

It will discuss issues including the extent that leagues and teams promote sports betting on their platforms and in their venues, and how much fans who do not want to be involved with sports betting should expect their sports consumption experiences to change.Programming descriptions are generated by participants and do not necessarily reflect the opinions of SXSW.|60

Great actions are a conversation. Conversational, natural language, interfaces are emerging as a powerful new way for people to interact with digital services. In order to design a natural user interface, we need to apply a human-centered design approach. Research by Stanford professor Clifford Nass shows that people converse with computers in much the same way as they do with humans. They are most successful when the interface is natural and conversational.  There’s a process for creating conversations. The Conversation Design Sprint teaches that process. This hands-on design sprint shows how to design and prototype a conversational experience using new Google Design Sprint methodologies. It presents the theory and principles of social interaction, crafting the personality and dialog of the conversational agent, the rapid prototyping of the conversation, and exploring how the conversation changes when it’s manifested on multimodal surfaces such as mobile and wearables.

Facebook’s React.js has quickly become the most popular front-end library in the world of web development, and a very marketable skill for any modern front-end or full-stack web developer.

As the popularity of React.js has grown, many developers have succeeded at pairing their React Apps with a Google Firebase backend.  Join General Assembly’s instructors for an interactive workshop as we walk you through integrating Google Firebase into a React App and explore the realtime database (one of it’s most popular features!).  Please note, this workshop is designed for people who have some experience building user interfaces with React.js, or has web development experience with a similar Javascript UI library like Angular or Vue. Requirements: - A laptop is required for this workshop. A Macbook is preferred, but not required. - Please install the create-react-app generator prior to class: https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app -This workshop is for junior web developers; some experience with React required.

Her DIY invention has stemmed not only from necessity - learning how to launch electronic loops live so she didn’t have to drag her keyboard to early pub gigs - but also from a desire to retain total creative control. Several major label overtures have been entertained down the years, but ultimately Bettinson has always preferred to pursue her own artistic vision. “I like my pop music a little bit weird,” she says. “I like it to challenge, to push the envelope a little bit — not just repeat what’s gone before.” This has been the case ever since those early performances, which earned Bettinson the attention of Radiohead producer Nigel Godrich, who recruited her to front electronic alt-pop group Ultraísta. Following rave reviews from Pitchfork, The Guardian and Rolling Stone, Bettinson then took a sabbatical to launch her solo career as FEMME.
