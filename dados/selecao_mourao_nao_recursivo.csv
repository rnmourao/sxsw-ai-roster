But before we allow AI to solve our problems, we need to solve its' biggest problem first: bias. As AI continues to spread, countless examples of bias have risen: from racist facial recognition to the proliferation of sexist language, AI is far from perfect. Before we let the cold, mathematical calculations of AI tackle our difficult questions, we need to rethink its algorithms, how they are written, and even who writes them. Our expert panel from across the nonprofit, industry, and education sectors will discuss ways we can tackle algorithmic bias.Programming descriptions are generated by participants and do not necessarily reflect the opinions of SXSW."

We call this “Wacko World,” and think it’s one of the biggest creative opportunities today. Attention has become an elusive metric as marketers compete with Drake memes for views once guaranteed with a TV ad.

In today’s interconnected world, reasons to experience fear are easily found with just a click of one’s remote, phone, or computer. Our perceptions of fear and threat from the mundane (“What! Who finished my ice cream!?”), to the life-threatening, are hard-wired defense responses, and are often involuntary, unconscious reactions.  In this fun and interactive aikido workshop, “Aiki Lab,” you will explore exercises that reveal your natural defenses, as well as offer embodiment skills for confidence-building, improved communication, and transcendence of fear.  Experience how utilizing ""beneficent intention"" can help overcome natural fear responses and create a peaceful outcome even in the face of unexpected fear/violence. Real real-life examples such as an individual who stopped a school shooting before it occurred will be discussed. Utilizing 30+ years of study and Aikido principals as taught by Morihei Ueshiba, Sensei Quakenbush discusses how peaceful communication practices and conflict resolution technologies like Aiki-Lab are imperative (both in daily life and globally) for human societies to survive, thrive, and evolve.

And in the developing world, only 15% of residents believe the systems in their country are working for them.

Blockchain technologies, through their inherent trust mechanisms, are a potential vehicle for building and restoring that trust by helping isolated communities get online, connected and verified to participate in the financial infrastructure that can empower entire regions. Solutions exist today, sometimes only requiring the smartphone in their hands, to circumvent the barriers to economic mobility.
