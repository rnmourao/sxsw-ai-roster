In today’s world of unprecedented stress, more women than ever are experiencing hormone imbalances that result in painful and irregular periods. Our society has normalized painful periods, when in fact they are not normal. As women it is our birthright to have pain-free periods. Our periods serve as a monthly report card evaluating our overall health. Today, the common solution to “cure” painful and irregular periods is with hormonal birth control which will only silence the symptoms instead of curing the root cause. When females learn how to harmonize with the natural rhythm of their cycles,they will experience a new type of body literacy which empowers them to operate at a higher vibration.This session explains how painful periods,PMS, and mood swings can and will be a thing of the past.

Great actions are a conversation. Conversational, natural language, interfaces are emerging as a powerful new way for people to interact with digital services. In order to design a natural user interface, we need to apply a human-centered design approach. Research by Stanford professor Clifford Nass shows that people converse with computers in much the same way as they do with humans. They are most successful when the interface is natural and conversational.  There’s a process for creating conversations. The Conversation Design Sprint teaches that process. This hands-on design sprint shows how to design and prototype a conversational experience using new Google Design Sprint methodologies. It presents the theory and principles of social interaction, crafting the personality and dialog of the conversational agent, the rapid prototyping of the conversation, and exploring how the conversation changes when it’s manifested on multimodal surfaces such as mobile and wearables.

However, our respective generational wisdom is almost in hermetically sealed containers with the wisdom trapped inside, like isolated countries that share a border but don’t necessarily trust each other. Breaking down these walls, there is just so much that we can all learn from each other. Based upon my experience as a Boomer in the land of the Millennials (Airbnb in Silicon Valley), I'm convinced that intergenerational wisdom exchange is the ultimate future workplace trade agreement.  This new collaboration may take the form of “mutual mentoring”: Millennial DQ (digital intelligence) for Boomer (and GenX) EQ (emotional intelligence). I experienced the benefits of this trade agreement as I evolved in my role at Airbnb while I was Head of Global Hospitality and Strategy and the in-house mentor for CEO and cofounder Brian Chesky. From my younger colleagues, I learned to love Google docs and create an Instagram account, but more importantly, I learned how to curate my life more adventurously as this generation is focused more on being “outwardly mobile” than “upwardly mobility,” more focused on experiencing the world than climbing the corporate ladder. They’ve helped me become a content and inspired “digital nomad” and break free of the chains of the three-stage life (learn, earn, retire).

A new generation of entrepreneurs are realizing their competitive advantages in the global economy and are discovering new ways to leverage them. New technologies and processes are pushing us toward borderless and frictionless commerce, but how can we enable this new paradigm in mutually beneficial ways? How can we prevent established ecosystems from using these same technologies to reinforce the dominance of North over South? Our panel will draw from their experiences in fostering new ecosystems in Africa, the Middle East, South Asia, and Latin America to illuminate promising solutions to these challenges.Programming descriptions are generated by participants and do not necessarily reflect the opinions of SXSW.

Brands can get involved at any stage, but the area with the most underutilized potential is spectatorship. When considering where to invest time and money, the burgeoning esports industry may not be top of mind (especially for non-endemic brands unfamiliar with the space) but it offers vital benefits in an increasingly digital world. Whether sponsoring streams, leagues, or players, some brands have already started to benefit from leveraging the opportunities that esports provide. With 250 million frequent viewers projected by 2021, this panel will discuss why brands should get involved now and how to harness the power of esports to reach an increasingly lucrative audience.

While dependence on connected technology has grown faster than our ability to secure it, friendly hackers improve public safety, public policy, and save lives - through security research. Yet media portrayals of hackers lack authenticity and fidelity, focused on harmful behavior and motivations, instead of diverse narratives in the real hacker community. Hacking is a superpower: for good or for ill. Better media role models will create the hacker heroes we need. Real world hackers team with fictional counterparts to examine hacker roles in society vs media. The audience will understand who hackers really are, who they can be, and what drives them - and will distinguish myth from reality.Programming descriptions are generated by participants and do not necessarily reflect the opinions of SXSW.

As the co-founder of the Ethereum blockchain and CEO of ConsenSys, Joe has spent the last five years building the Ethereum ecosystem and bringing bold visions of decentralization to reality. Five years into the Ethereum project and we’ve seen technologists, entrepreneurs, governments, enterprises, and financial institutions exploring (and in some cases betting on) Ethereum as the foundation for a new, shared global infrastructure.  Joining Joe on stage will be Manoush Zomorodi, the host of the popular tech podcast ZigZag. No stranger to blockchain, Manoush has been celebrated for her observations, analysis and humanizing take on blockchain and crypto, a world she jumped into head first when her new venture, StableGenius, partnered with ConsenSys-backed Civil, a media platform for sustainable journalism.  Join Manoush for a candid conversation with one of the most influential figures in blockchain as she asks the questions that the world has been wondering, including questions about Joe's unconventional road to Ethereum and ConsenSys, his hopes for Ethereum 2.0, his honest take on the ecosystem in a bear market, and where this giant experiment-- to decentralize the world’s systems using blockchain technology-- is all headed.
