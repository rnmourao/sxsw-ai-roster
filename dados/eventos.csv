25|Mar 12, 2019|217 Congress Ave. Austin, TX, EUA|Locate S,1|9:40pm|9:00pm|Cooper's BBQ|Having rotated between a handful of cast and characters under various titles over the years  (Jepeto Solutions, CE Schneider Topical, Christina Schneider's Genius Grant...) Schneider has settled on the pop moniker Locate S,1 for her newest album, Healing Contest. Healing Contest stands out as the fully realized, high-fidelity collaboration pairing Schneider’s compositions with the iconic creative force behind of Montreal. Produced, engineered and mixed by Kevin Barnes, Healing Contest is the debut release from Barnes' new label, Sybaritic Peer. On Healing Contest, Schneider is back with a futuristic palette of electronic drums, funky bass lines, and quietly hyperactive chord progressions that are sure to impress even the most learned musical millennial. Locate S,1 is the result of a seasoned songwriter cum lo-fi home-recorder delving into the world of mid-fi pop, with results that are pleasantly difficult to define; a technical tour-de-force that extrapolates high-brow jazz harmonics and prog-rock time signatures into a whole menagerie of new forms—all while still passing as pop.

26|Mar 12, 2019|217 Congress Ave. Austin, TX, EUA|Charli Adams|10:40pm|10:00pm|Cooper's BBQ|Charli Adams, a Nashville based singer/songwriter pairs her dreamy, haunting voice with raw and ruminative lyrics creating a distinct and recognizable sound. Her live shows transcend to a familiar, nostalgic experience while she bears her own intimate anecdotes with her audience. Originally from southern Alabama, Charli’s songwriting collides with her sweet, slow paced roots and the fresh, electric joy and pain that youth provides. Her music serves as a nod to the old and the new, drawing from the sounds of timeless classic rock artists by the likes of Tom Petty, Neil Young, and Elliott Smith, while diverging the moods of current indie power houses such as Ryan Adams, The 1975, and The Paper Kites. While performing in venues all over Nashville, she recently created her first buzz worthy album titled “Good At Being Young” (to be released soon), prefaced with four unique singles. A collection of thoughtful odes to the ebb and flow of a lust for life, Good at Being Young offers a call to action for listeners young and old to cascade into the depths of their own coming of age stories.

27|Mar 12, 2019|217 Congress Ave. Austin, TX, EUA|Living Hour|12:40am|12:00am|Cooper's BBQ|Living Hour creates a weightless atmosphere with a musically imaginative energy. The band’s new material is a beautiful and mellow amalgamation of guitar-centered dream pop and powerful, emotive lead vocals.Sam Sarty’s vocals are at the forefront as she explores vulnerable material and looks inward, grappling with themes of self determination, independence, and isolation. Sarty’s captivating performance combines confidence and vulnerability. With three voices, guitar, trombone, brushed percussion, and boundless effects, Living Hour’s live show maintains the dreamy, emotional power of the band’s recordings resulting in a mesmerizing, unforgettable, cathartic, and deeply moving live music experience. Living Hour’s music commands attention, washing over the listener with lush sounds and healing energy. (Bound to thrill fans of Beach House, Yo La Tengo, Grizzly Bear, and Japanese Breakfast.)

28|Mar 12, 2019|217 Congress Ave. Austin, TX, EUA|TOMKAT|1:50am|1:00am|Cooper's BBQ|For TOMKAT, a band based out of Denton, Texas whose work spends much of its time buried in the grey areas between pop, jazz, rock and dance music, the idea of coordinating complex sounds and musical meters is at the heart of their cross-genre investigations. Led by the haunting croon and ache of Katrina Cain’s voice, as well as the dynamic rhythmic interplay that exists within the band, TOMKAT are looking to express their native pop and electronic instincts without sacrificing their evolved temperament to the confines of a modern musical marketplace. Drawn from all areas of the country, the band was founded in 2015 by vocalist Katrina Cain (Connecticut), guitarist Andrew McMillan (El Paso), bassist Mike Luzecky (St. Louis) and drummer Jonny Harmon (Columbus) who first met as students at the University of North Texas. TOMKAT's full length album, Icarus, was recorded in July of 2016 with Tanner Landry of Fort Worth Sound, though the music had been written and sat waiting for over a year prior. Cain, McMillan, Luzecky and Harmon had longed for a more electronic element than their current sound possessed, and found those pulsating and metronomic sounds with Trenton Hull (synthesizer), Programming descriptions are generated by participants and do not necessarily reflect the opinions of SXSW.|30.2649407|-97.7436259
29|Mar 13, 2019|217 Congress Ave. Austin, TX, EUA|The Brother Brothers|8:40pm|8:00pm|Cooper's BBQ|The Brother Brothers are Adam and David Moss, identical twins carrying on the folk tradition for a new generation. Using minimal instrumentation, heartfelt lyricism, and harmonies so natural they seem to blend into one beautiful voice, the siblings draw on the energy and creativity of Brooklyn, New York for their full-length debut album, Some People I Know.  The Brother Brothers’ acoustic project emerges from several years spent traveling the country, both separately and together, playing in varying ensembles and sometimes settling in separate cities. Though each writes his fair share of the discography independently, the brothers’ palpable fraternal bond produces a togetherness in these songs that few bands can offer.  Although young men, The Brother Brothers have boasted this sterling folk sound for decades. Growing up in Peoria, Illinois, they sang along as children to their father’s record collection of the Kingston Trio, the Everly Brothers, the Beatles, and the Beach Boys. “That's where we learned to sing harmony and then one thing leads to another,” says Adam. “All of a sudden we could harmonize to anything we wanted to. It was a very natural progression.” Programming descriptions are generated by participants and do not necessarily reflect the opinions of SXSW.|30.2649407|-97.7436259
30|Mar 13, 2019|217 Congress Ave. Austin, TX, EUA|The Yawpers|9:40pm|9:00pm|Cooper's BBQ|The Yawpers craft tunes that are engrossed in creative context. Some might recall edges of the mid-1900s Delta blues, but only if those lived-in riffs were played by the MC5, broadcast through booming stadium speakers and drenched with pounds of fuzzy distortion and full-throttled punk rock energy. They conduct parallel frequencies with the ferocious and raw proletarian roots of Uncle Tupelo, the burning-hot thrashings and cavernous sonic space of Hot Snakes, and mix in derisive scrutiny that brings to mind Ween or the Minutemen (and might we add that Cook is the spitting image of D. Boon).Programming descriptions are generated by participants and do not necessarily reflect the opinions of SXSW.|30.2649407|-97.7436259

The 39-year-old still lives on several acres not far from the Holly Springs, Mississippi, home where he was raised by “Big Daddy,” his grandfather, the late singer/songwriter/guitarist R.L. Burnside whom Cedric famously played with, just as his own father, drummer Calvin Jackson, did.  Cedric was literally born to the blues, more specifically, the “rhythmically unorthodox” Hill country variant which emerged from Mississippi, where he grew up surrounded (and influenced) by Junior Kimbrough, Jessie May Hemphill and Otha Turner, as well as delta musicians T-Model Ford and Paul “Wine” Jones.

His latest album, Turmoil & Tinfoil, taps into a deep vein of psychedelia in Americana, referencing everything from the Dead to Sturgill Simpson, but all underlaid by Billy’s undeniable virtuosity and his knowledge of the roots of American music. He’s one of the most beloved young bluegrass guitarists today within the bluegrass community, and his front porch in East Nashville is constantly filled up with Nashville’s best roots musicians just picking up a storm.  Billy and his band are planning to release a second full length LP in Fall 2019.

The Philadelphia-based musicians, who met at an industry party in late 2016, knew of each other’s music prior to their first encounter, but soon decided to share ideas with one another in the studio and independently came to the same conclusion: to form a group and create along the same wavelength. “There are a lot of instances of finishing each other's sentences or those unspoken things,” explains Chill. “Right now, music is the vessel we’re using to advance the message of inspiration, motivation, healing and upliftment,” adds Donn T. “But, at the core, that’s who we both are. So, it’s not surprising for us to have some kind of community service initiative or social justice effort connected to our shows or the music, something or other that we’re a part of, that helps make our surroundings, the world or maybe just one person’s life, better. That’s key.” Debuting as &More (Chill Moody & Donn T) at the annual Roots Jam Session last January in the lead-up to Grammy week, the pair settled on a band name in reference to festival lineups that state “and more” at the bottom of f Programming descriptions are generated by participants and do not necessarily reflect the opinions of SXSW.|30.2649407|-97.7436259

She’s played SXSW, Austin City Limits Festival, 2018 NFL Draft, Chicago and Austin Food and Wine Fest and the famous Apollo Theater in New York.

35|Mar 14, 2019|217 Congress Ave. Austin, TX, EUA|Arkansas Dave|8:40pm|8:00pm|Cooper's BBQ|It’s a romantic cliché to find an escape in music and the blues, but living that life is a different matter. Ask Arkansas Dave about growing up in a broken home, with fundamental Christianity on one side, and crippling drug-addiction on the other, and you can see in his eyes that this is no easy ride, and that at times music really was his only friend. Chasing his dream of music, Dave played in bands, funding his music with a succession of jobs where he had to find his feet quickly – from busboy to assembly-worker in a trash-bag factory. His wake up call came at the edge of a breakdown with a cataclysmic weekend epiphany. He headed home for a rare visit, and was persuaded to play a few songs to his family. The response he got from his grandfather sent his mind racing, only for him to find out the next week that his grandfather had died 24 hours later. Determined to clean himself up, and sort his life, Arkansas Dave enrolled on an audio engineering course at Media Tech in Austin Texas, driving into town with a trailer loaded with all his possessions, ‘like something out of the Beverly Hillbillies’. And that’s where everything changed – the college was housed at that time in the f Programming descriptions are generated by participants and do not necessarily reflect the opinions of SXSW.|30.2649407|-97.7436259

It proved to be a brave decision that gave her immeasurable experience as a musician, insight into the machinations of the industry and a contract with the legendary RCA Records. Upon returning to Australia in 2009, Catherine set about recording her debut full length album Dusty Smiles and Heartbreak Cures, the first of five consecutive albums nominated for Album Of The Year at the CMAA (Country Music Awards of Australia). The accolades didn’t stop there. Along the way she has received five Golden Guitar Awards, the CMA Global Artist Of The Year award in 2010 and six ARIA Award nominations for Best Country Album.  The critical acclaim for her albums and reputation as a performer has seen Catherine tour and perform with some of the biggest names in music, including Sir Elton John, Don McLean, Kasey Chambers, Brooks & Dunn, Alan Jackson, Brad Paisley, Dolly Parton, Kenny Chesney, Steve Earle, Guy Clark, Chris Isaak and Keith Urban.

Lauren Morrow recently released her new album as a solo artist after over a decade as the centerpiece of popular Americana band The Whiskey Gentry. The self-titled, four song EP is filled with stories; some real, some fiction, all universal yet personal. Morrow and her husband, guitarist, and co-producer Jason recruited an all-star lineup of Nashville’s most notable players for the new project, including drummer Jerry Pentecost, pedal steel player Whit Wright, bassist Ted Pecchio, guitarist Adam Meisterhans, and former Deer Tick member Robbie Crowell on keys. Recorded at the historic Nashville studio Creative Workshop with producer/engineer Parker Cason, the Lauren Morrow EP not only showcases Morrow’s flawless vocals and intricate songwriting, but her willingness to take risks — an edge that makes her stand out from the Nashville norm. Whether she’s singing a murder ballad or an vintage, classic-country sounding banger, there’s a unique impression she leaves that lingers. You don’t want to miss it.

Dorothy Alice is the full-length follow-up to his EP “Worth It,” named one of 2017’s Best Colorado Albums by Colorado Public Radio’s Open Air. Emerson began writing the album when he found himself down and out in LA; his band had broken up, his relationship was falling apart, and he was sleeping in his car.  When he received the news that a dear loved one had passed away, he knew it was time for a drastic move. Emerson packed up and moved back to Colorado, where he found his footing and completed the album full of swift fingerpicking, tell-all lyrics, the slickness of LA and the earnestness of Colorado. Emerson’s music has been compared to the likes of Big Thief, Elliot Smith, and Andy Shauf. He and his band has shared the stage with the likes of Charles Bradley, Twin Peaks, The Districts, Will Butler (of Arcade Fire), Jeff the Brotherhood, La Luz, and many more.

39|Mar 14, 2019|217 Congress Ave. Austin, TX, EUA|Curse Of Lono|1:50am|1:00am|Cooper's BBQ|Curse Of Lono released their second album ‘As I Fell’ in August 2018. Produced by Oli Bayston (Boxed In) at Rancho V in Joshua Tree, California and Flesh & Bone in London, ‘As I Fell’, entered the Official Americana Albums Charts at No. 10 and the Official Independent Albums Breakers Chart at No. 15 in the UK.  ‘As I Fell’ builds on the band’s deeply cinematic blend of harmony-laden Americana and driving, gothic alt-rock. It’s a sound that owes as much to old faithfuls like The Doors and The Velvet Underground as it does to more modern practitioners of the form such as The War On Drugs and Wilco.  The album has been accompanied by a short documentary 'Somewhere In Their Heads' which has won Best Short Documentary at the LA Edge Film Awards and the Changing Face International Film Festival in Sydney. Curse Of Lono, who formed in London in 2015, are Felix Bechtolsheimer (vocals, guitar), Joe Hazell (lead guitar and vocals), Dani Ruiz Hernandez (keys and vocals), Charis Anderson (bass and vocals) and Neil Findlay (drums). Curse Of Lono received the prestigious Bob Harris Emerging Artist Award at the UK Americana Awards in January.

Songs like “She Is Waiting” prove that they’re just as comfortable launching into a heavy, alt-country breakdown as they are a world-weary lyrical stream of consciousness. The Prescriptions channel a broad range of influences, from the aching, unaffected honesty of ‘70s folk titans like Neil Young, to the guitar-driven melodies of The Strokes’ early recordings and the experimental energy of Wilco.

She has toured throughout the US and Europe, both headlining and also touring with The Black Keys, Mavis Staples, Nick Cave & the Bad Seeds, Primal Scream, Chris Isaak, JD McPherson, the Avett Brothers and many more.

Both lyrically and sonically, she strikes a fiercely independent chord, proudly releasing a deeply personal record that reflects her own upbringing in Tennessee, including the prejudices and injustices that she witnessed as a child that continue to impact her life to this day. According to Rae, ""this album was born out of a need to do some healing work in my personal life, in order to address some fears and patterns of mine to allow my true feelings to come to the surface.""  Recorded in the dead of winter in an old Franciscan monastery on Wisconsin’s Fox River, the isolated environment created the perfect setting for Rae and her bandmates to track these genre-busting songs, using the chapel and other unique spaces within the cavernous building to explore new sonic boundaries, all while continuing to showcase the hypnotic vocals and song-serving restraint that have become her trademark.

43|Mar 15, 2019|217 Congress Ave. Austin, TX, EUA|John Paul White|11:40pm|11:00pm|Cooper's BBQ|With The Hurting Kind, John Paul White has crafted a stunning album that draws on the lush, orchestrated music made in Nashville in the early 1960s. Yet these songs retain a modern feel, whether he's writing about overwhelming love, unraveling relationships, or the fading memory of a loved one. White grew up in tiny Loretto, Tennessee, and now lives in Florence, Alabama, not far from Muscle Shoals. He has cultivated his career in Nashville for two decades, first as a songwriter for a major publisher, then as half of The Civil Wars – a groundbreaking duo that won four Grammy Awards before disbanding in 2012. Because The Civil Wars were so hard to categorize, White has earned a fan base among indie rock listeners, folk audiences, Americana outlets, and AAA radio. So, what will happen if people hear The Hurting Kind and call it country? “Well, that doesn’t scare me in the least,” he says. “As a matter of fact, it kind of thrills me.” Programming descriptions are generated by participants and do not necessarily reflect the opinions of SXSW.|30.2649407|-97.7436259

Along with his band, the New Strangers, the Kernal tours the country with his home-grown brand of Southern mystique. LIGHT COUNTRY introduces us to a funny, whip-smart songwriter and musical stylist on these original tracks. The album opens with the sweeping gospel number, “Where We’re Standing,” which builds to a swirling electric guitar outro. He describes “Knock Kneed Ballerina” as a “shoulder-dance country song and a sort of personal, band- mission statement;” it’s also a knowing nod to the classic sound of ‘70s Nashville Countrypolitan hits and a poignant ode to musical also-rans everywhere. “At the Old Taco Bell” was inspired by a photo of a boarded up, derelict Taco Bell. “It’s about me moving into an abandoned, and therefore affordable, Taco Bell at some point in the future,” he deadpans. Elsewhere he tackles modern domesticity (the Harry Nilsson-esque “Cold Shoulder”), and ends on an apology of sorts for his choice of lifestyle, “I earned my degree but I would rather rake some leaves.

The 39-year-old still lives on several acres not far from the Holly Springs, Mississippi, home where he was raised by “Big Daddy,” his grandfather, the late singer/songwriter/guitarist R.L. Burnside whom Cedric famously played with, just as his own father, drummer Calvin Jackson, did.  Cedric was literally born to the blues, more specifically, the “rhythmically unorthodox” Hill country variant which emerged from Mississippi, where he grew up surrounded (and influenced) by Junior Kimbrough, Jessie May Hemphill and Otha Turner, as well as delta musicians T-Model Ford and Paul “Wine” Jones. Grammy-nominated in 2015 for Best Blues Album for the Cedric Burnside Project’s Descendants of Hill Country, as well as the recipient of the Blues Music Awards honor as Drummer of the Year for four consecutive years, Benton County Relic offers a showcase for his electric and acoustic guitar, recording 26 tracks in just two days.

Smith’s list of accolades is astounding – boasting a steady stream of awards from the title of youngest person to play the Grand Ole Opry to touring as lead violinist for artists like Willie Nelson, Lady Gaga, Blues Traveler, Local Natives and performed alongside acts like Sheryl Crow & ZZ Top. Ruby Jane is currently working with well known pop producer Mario Marchetti out of Los Angeles on her new EP set to release in 2019.

Lightbeam boasts intensely personal lyrics - “heaven knows our souls, our story / the shape of your heart when you hold me / wouldn’t tear us apart or disown me” - strong melodic hooks and a pop aesthetic that showcase Chavez’s versatility on five unapologetically personal tracks that explore longing, faith, beauty and sacrifice. Fresh off a 14-country tour as an ambassador with the U.S. State Department, Chavez and her band are touring the U.S. in support of Lightbeam.

In 2018 they released their third album “While I Was Asleep” worldwide on Jansen Records, and one could hear a slightly different and revitalized Darling West. Relentless touring and playing big festival stages has served as a catalyst to give them more edge and confidence. While continuing to play their sweet Americana/Cosmic Folk, the music has more drive and the melodies are catchier than before.  The album received great reviews from Uncut Magazine, Greil Marcus in The Village Voice, Classic Rock Magazine, Americana UK, Folk Radio UK, Belwood Music, Americana Highways and many more.

The band has done a lot of growing up since then, seeing its members through the life changes that accompany waxing youth - weddings, babies, careers, settling down, starting over.  The self-titled album is colored by these changes, touching on unfulfilled dreams, honest and flawed relationships, an uncertain world - shot through with glimpses of light streaming in through the cracks.  The result of all this is an evolved but still defiant Western Youth - introspective and poetic, but full of piss and vinegar, a unique sound that staggers artfully between rock n' roll, folk, americana, and something, well, more grown up.

Even with such compulsive overproduction of the images of ourselves, we might end up with nothing but the blank memories of our past. Even the data on ourselves will eventually fade away… The installation consists of a display that prompts you to take a selfie on your phone, which it renders in digital particles on a large 1×1 meter screen. Then a moment later, your face scatters and falls apart and the real black gravel starts to fall at the bottom of the screen in perfect synchrony with the digital simulation. Gradually, a dark mound builds up at the foot of the construction.

Are we willing to brave the wilderness of uncertainty and criticism by showing up and speaking out? Or, are the consequences too high, and do we instead opt for staying quiet, hiding out in our ideological bunkers, or trying to fit in and slide by? In this keynote, we’ll explore how true belonging requires us to believe in and belong to ourselves so fully that we can find sacredness both in being a part of something and in standing alone when necessary. What does it mean to show up, be seen, and live brave, and, more importantly, what price do we pay for our comfortable silence?

The failures become definitional, but even the successes still somehow feel hollow. When we don’t define success in our own terms, finding our purpose and carving our own path becomes impossible‫. ‬   Success is not just about money and power and access. It’s about calling, connection, contribution, and control. It’s about consonance, when the “what” we do matches the “who” we are, in pursuit of living a life of consequence‫.‬ Programming descriptions are generated by participants and do not necessarily reflect the opinions of SXSW.|30.2642649|-97.7392938

What if the right tech could make killing a thing of the past? That’s the provocative thesis at the heart of Rick Smith’s new book, The End of Killing. In this session, he’ll dive into the technological developments that will make killing outdated. He’ll show that this isn’t just a bold claim, but that this change is happening all around us, without many of us knowing. Just as the iPhone changed communications and the TV changed media, the latest tech is changing how cops, soldiers, courts, and many others do their work. Drawing on the latest creations in advanced weaponry, biotechnology, and AI, he’ll demonstrate how premeditated violence might soon be something we look at the way we look at the horse-and-buggy.

They have blossomed as a ray of light for the progressive strains of Brazilian society. Like Occupy Wall Street, the student movement uses direct democracy to decide everything, always voting for their next steps together. As I wrote the script for a feature film about the movement, questions recurred for me: Isn't a film director an authority? How could I make the audience enter the story and learn about the material in an emotional way?  The panel will discuss the Brazilian social situation and the students’ battle, and reflect on the best ways to transform this story into an interactive film.

77|Mar 8, 2019|500 E Cesar Chavez Austin, TX, EUA|What Makes Critics Love, or Hate, a Movie?|3:00pm|2:00pm|Austin Convention Center Room 12AB|Every filmmaker knows waiting for reviews to come out after your premiere can be nerve-wracking. Great reviews can elevate your film, giving it legs for further festival exposure and  capturing the attention of potential distributors. Negative reviews during a festival run can create hurdles for an independent film in a crowded marketplace. Acquisitions executives approach reviews as a harbinger of how the film can be positioned or how it would play in public.  Thus, reviews can be an important measurement for film’s future success. Moderated by Miranda Bailey, the founder and CEO of CherryPicks, a site that amplifies the female critical voice in film, this lively conversation will explore how critics analyze films—the parameters they have in mind, as well as how their personal identities and genre preferences impact how they view and assess the films they see. And most importantly, what you can do, as a filmmaker and distributor, to best position your films for positive reviews today. Trust us: You won’t want to miss this one.

The question revolved around *what type of media gets delivered?* Do AVs lend themselves best to social media, video, music, games or something new?

How do we channel our drive, our ingenuity, our passions, even our pain, into something more meaningful than individual success? And what is our duty to others where we live, work and play? I have spent my life trying to answer these questions.  I grew in the public housing projects of Brooklyn. My only inheritance was my mother’s belief that I could create a better life for myself. I became the first in my family to go to college, and went on to live the American Dream. When I joined Starbucks in the mid-80s, I never set out to build a global brand, but to build a company that cared about profits as well as humanity. From our earliest days, we set out to share our success with our people and to care for communities that we served, as well as those beyond our own. By staying true to our values, Starbucks redefined the role of a company in society. Time and again, especially during these past few years, we challenged preconceived notions of what it means to be a responsible corporate citizen. Never has it been so important for we as citizens to use our creative muscles to help society solve its most pressing problems, including more equal access to education, jobs and healthcare. Today, I’ll be sharing with you some of the most important lessons I have learned, including what it means not to be bystander, and that we are all in this together.

When Viagra was up for approval through the FDA, the little blue pill was submitted with data from 4,213 subjects, was granted priority review to expedite the cause, and went through a six-month approval process. When Addyi, the first drug for female sexual desire approached the FDA, it was denied priority review despite having supporting data from 13,851 subjects, and faced a six-year approval process. The gender gap in pharmaceuticals is egregious. Despite addressing an unmet medical need, drugs for women have had a harder time going to market because of the pharmaceutical industry’s sluggish and antiquated processes.

Revival sitcom Roseanne broke ratings records before it was cancelled and Murphy Brown will return this fall. Films about Tonya Harding and Anita Hill are winning awards, and Miranda from Sex and the City is running for governor of New York. Against this backdrop of 90s nostalgia, 90s BITCH: Media, Culture, and the Failed Promise of Gender Equality by Allison Yarrow reexamines the stories that were told and sold about women during the decade—stories that shaped the Millennial generation and help explain the status of women in America today. An interview with the author will cover how 90s Bitchification can explain #MeToo and harassment in the social media age. It will illuminate how we can be better media consumers to call out sexism and abuse.

Even with such compulsive overproduction of the images of ourselves, we might end up with nothing but the blank memories of our past. Even the data on ourselves will eventually fade away… The installation consists of a display that prompts you to take a selfie on your phone, which it renders in digital particles on a large 1×1 meter screen. Then a moment later, your face scatters and falls apart and the real black gravel starts to fall at the bottom of the screen in perfect synchrony with the digital simulation. Gradually, a dark mound builds up at the foot of the construction.

They weren’t wealth, privilege, or even genius. It was that all of these exceptional men and women made a big bet, took risks, learned from their failures, reached beyond their bubble, and let urgency conquer fear.

In the past few years, stunning title sequences have captivated audiences all over the world and are short pieces of compelling content in their own right. Simultaneously, the rise of streaming and binge-watching culture has led some to skip even the most artful titles on their second or third episode in one sitting – they just saw the titles an hour ago, right? Title designers are in limbo; absolutely required on one hand and dismissed on the other. The creators behind some of the most highly lauded episodic title sequences (Stranger Things, Altered Carbon, Godless, The Man in the High Castle and more) talk about how to keep audiences engaged and explore the future of the art form.

Cars couldn’t care less about compassion. Our home assistants are barely aware if we are shouting in frustration or joking around. Technology is developing more IQ, but it lacks EQ. Emotional artificial intelligence promises to fix our emotion-dumb technology but the real power may be in that layer between people and product—design. Whether a designer, developer, information architect, product manager, entrepreneur, chatbot script writer, AI trainer, or investor, Emotionally Intelligent Design urges you to reconsider the emotional side of technology and suggests new ways to design with a blend of human and machine emotional intelligence. With this book, Pamela Pavliscak—a futurist, professor, and advisor to companies developing emotion AI—gives a behind-the-scenes look at the latest work in the field and guidelines for ethical and compassionate use.

While new media platforms have expanded opportunities for diverse journalists and story-tellers to create, curate and distribute news and entertainment content, additional support and proactive efforts are needed to help these diverse new entrants find a path to being discovered by an audience and to profitability. This panel session is the next installment in our Media Diversity Solutions Discussion Series and is designed to provide journalists, storytellers, curators and media platform developers of color insights into current challenges and opportunities to profitably create, curate, and distribute news and scripted programming. Our blue-ribbon panel will discuss the state of the industry and innovative efforts being undertaken or proposed to generate increased diversity. The goal of this panel is to give the audience insights on what it takes to overcome these challenges, and to give MMCA greater awareness about how to most effectively work with media industry leaders and policymakers to support and scale efforts to increase media diversity.Programming descriptions are generated by participants and do not necessarily reflect the opinions of SXSW.|30.2642649|-97.7392938

You can’t always rely on other members of your team to do that for you and often enough, more people will see these parts of your story than will see your actual film. Our panel will dive into every step in the process (in actionable tips), from inspiring people as early as the script and lookbook, to developing marketing buzz in post-production, to publicity and distribution after the fact. And we’ll speak to the biggest aspiration of all - to make people genuinely excited for you as a creator.

Can the collective experience of the movie theatre be enhanced by multioptional storytelling? Or is there a need of a physical experience through virtual reality and robotics technology? Two Swiss artists and entrepreneurs have found with ‚Somniacs‘ and ‚ctrl movie‘ very diverging answers, on how an interactive cinema could look like.

"|3:00pm|2:00pm|Austin Convention Center Room 16AB|The Women’s Evolution in WWE and Beyond Brave women and men from all walks of life are stepping into the spotlight to shine a brighter light on gender equality gaps. This industry shift has brought global attention to the need for women to have greater opportunities.  	 In February 2015, WWE fans created the viral hashtag #GiveDivasAChance as a rallying cry for female performers to be featured in more prominent storylines. WWE has since responded with the Women’s Revolution. No longer known as “Divas,” WWE “Superstars” now receive more air time to showcase their athleticism. WWE has not only increased its dynamic female fan base, but is actively empowering women inside and outside the ring. This will be a discussion focused on the broader industry relevance of women’s empowerment and the leadership needed to foster change.

The so-called “Uncanny Valley” has been centered around visual resemblance. With the rise of AI and the access to interactive tech, there is a new Uncanny Valley being created through human-like characters and interactions - where the focus is on narrative rather than visuals. This creates an opportunity to redefine how people engage and interact with machines, and with each other.  This new paradigm will not only require new tools, like storyboarding in VR (Galatea), emotion-driven music (Melodrive), expressive 3D characters and faces (Expressive.AI) but also new approaches to promote introspective interactions (Where Thoughts Go).

Blum is a two-time Academy Award-nominated and two-time Emmy and Peabody Award-winning producer. His multi-media company is known for pioneering a new model of studio filmmaking: producing high-quality micro-budget films. How the hell did he get from there to here and how do these two view that evolution?

132|Mar 9, 2019|500 E Cesar Chavez Austin, TX, EUA|No Hard Feelings: Emotions at Work|4:30pm|3:30pm|Austin Convention Center Room 10AB| When it comes to emotions at work, there's rarely a happy medium. In some offices, your boss might send snaps of her weekend getaway in Vegas, or your coworker might send twenty texts about how Susan ate his clearly labeled lunch...again. Other offices are buttoned-up emotional deserts, where crying is only allowed in the bathroom and you suspect your coworkers might be robots. Either extreme hurts employee health and productivity.       Liz Fosslien and Mollie West Duffy take a charming and deeply researched look at how emotions affect our professional lives and how we can navigate emotions at work. The modern workplace can be an emotional minefield (Do I shake my boss's hand or give her a hug? Did I forget to mute my phone on the conference call?) filled with unwritten rules.

134|Mar 9, 2019|500 E Cesar Chavez Austin, TX, EUA|Waiting Rooms: A Building-Sized Installation|4:30pm|3:30pm|Austin Convention Center Ballroom G|An architect, a game designer and two producers took over the Museum of Science to create a first-of-its-kind experience in Boston. Waiting Rooms is an absurdist social bureaucracy that takes over existing institutions, letting visitors into spaces where they are not normally allowed. Simple rules steer individuals as they wander from room to room, leading to sometimes collaborative and sometimes competitive situations. With no formal set or plot, the only story that happens are the choices a participant makes. The result is a complex experience of bureaucracy, immigration, economic inequality, and the systemization of contemporary life. In this session, we discuss how the physical installation was conceived, how it transformed the museum and the “players,” and plans for future iterations.

139|Mar 9, 2019|500 E Cesar Chavez Austin, TX, EUA|Telling Urgent Stories with Interactive Maps|6:00pm|5:00pm|Austin Convention Center Ballroom G|Maps are a powerful, but under-explored tool for storytelling and documentary. They can bring huge amounts of information together and help to make sense of it, but dealing with overwhelming amounts of data is also their biggest challenge. This session looks at a recent online documentary, Migration Trail, to explore the possibilities for telling stories in interactive maps and data. We’ll share the sometimes surprising lessons we learned about what works and what doesn’t when telling stories with interactive maps, the ethical challenges of working with this format and how audiences interact with it. Migration Trail is a mapped data visualisation which follows a series of fictional migrants traveling to Europe in real time, over ten days. It launched in November 2017.

While AI will never replace great human storytellers, it will enable us to tell more interactive and personalized stories in ways we have yet to imagine.

Even with such compulsive overproduction of the images of ourselves, we might end up with nothing but the blank memories of our past. Even the data on ourselves will eventually fade away… The installation consists of a display that prompts you to take a selfie on your phone, which it renders in digital particles on a large 1×1 meter screen. Then a moment later, your face scatters and falls apart and the real black gravel starts to fall at the bottom of the screen in perfect synchrony with the digital simulation. Gradually, a dark mound builds up at the foot of the construction.

My session will explore the explore the ways my journey and experience directly lead to the development of the transmedia project ‘Blood Speaks’ which explores the use of traditions and culture to normalise violence against women.  Through the a combined use of traditional (photography) and emergent technologies (VR/interactive) I use testimonies from the majority world, to reveal the agency, independence and voice of those often perceived to be poor and powerless.  In the wake of the MeToo movement, such voices are a crucial, but often excluded, component of the global dialogue and technology is the bridge to bring them together with equality.

Through seminal projects, such as Billy Klüver’s ‘Experiments for Art and Technology’ (1966) – which brought artists together with engineers - Obrist will highlight the early antecedents of art’s relationship to technology. From the Serpentine Galleries’ digital commission of James Bridle to Sondra Perry’s blue screen technology and 3D avatars to Ian Cheng’s sentient artwork, BOB (Bag of Beliefs), Obrist will propose artists as significant producers of our future realities. The lecture will also address the danger that things may be lost, such as the extinction of cultural phenomena and, with reference to Édouard Glissant, the importance of resisting the homogenizing forces of globalisation in our digital age.

We are moving from an era when there were few limits on societal, economic, and population growth to one in which there are limits and in which growth will necessarily slow.  In the process, values such as competition, independence, and unrestrained exploitation of resources will be replaced by those of cooperation, interdependence, and sustainability.  The conflict and confusion that we see in the world today is a manifestation of that shift.

Founder of Daybreaker - the massive morning dance party that occurs monthly in 25 cities worldwide and has a community of almost half a million people – named  “one of 8 women who will change the world” by MTV, and author of BELONG: Find Your People, Create Community, and Live a More Connected Life, she has dedicated her adult life to fostering connection and community in a fragmented, disconnected world. It’s the great paradox of the digital age: the internet connects us to millions of people, yet we feel more isolated than ever with 1 in 4 Americans saying they have zero friends to confide in. Social media has become the new fast food—the initial rush of happiness and instant gratification quickly replaced by feelings of loneliness and disconnect once the phone is put down. It’s easy to get likes but hard to make a friend. Agrawal calls this “community confusion.” Through her work with Daybreaker and national brands such as Nike and Whole Foods, Agrawal has worked to end that trend and create a sense of belonging for all.

You are entitled to your informed opinion. No one is entitled to be ignorant.”           -Harlan Ellison Perennial film critic Leonard Maltin is the ultimate movie fan and his reviews are legendary. But...are they *right*? In the spirit of kindness and with the communal understanding that film is subjective and opinions come in all colors of the rainbow, You're Wrong, Leonard Maltin gives audience members a rare opportunity to challenge the movie master himself on his categorical cinematic conclusions. It’s a conversation between battling beliefs...and possibly the only chance you will ever get in your entire life to convince Leonard Maltin that his movie methodology is mortally mistaken, and, in fact, WRONG. Perhaps best known for his eponymous annual book of movie capsule reviews, Leonard Maltin's Movie Guide, which was published from 1969 to 2014, Leonard Maltin and his daughter Jessie, who together host the ""Maltin on Movies"" podcast for the Nerdist network, are willing to take on all comers who have a gripe over one of Leonard's reviews.

It takes imagination and empathy to see the human potential of new technology. It takes curiosity and obsessive craft to develop a grammar for new media formats. Unfortunately, most companies treat creatives like petulant children, and most creatives surrender leadership to “businessmen.” The future is too important to leave to operations and finance. It’s time for creatives to step forward and organizations to prioritize creative vision.

Even with such compulsive overproduction of the images of ourselves, we might end up with nothing but the blank memories of our past. Even the data on ourselves will eventually fade away… The installation consists of a display that prompts you to take a selfie on your phone, which it renders in digital particles on a large 1×1 meter screen. Then a moment later, your face scatters and falls apart and the real black gravel starts to fall at the bottom of the screen in perfect synchrony with the digital simulation. Gradually, a dark mound builds up at the foot of the construction.

Here's a DIY guide on how to continue learning using the free resources at your local library. Susan Kerns: Using Film Festivals to Launch and Sustain Your Career  In the age of YouTube and streaming services galore, many filmmakers are starting careers online instead of navigating the film festival circuit. So why are film festivals still thriving, and how can filmmakers use festivals to build sustainable careers? This discussion focuses on ways emerging filmmakers can find the right festival fits for their films and then use festivals for more than just a standalone screening space.  Tracy Heather Strain: Know Your People: The Key to Crowdfunding Success Sure crowdfunding is all about raising money, but it’s also a chance early in your project to identify and engage with “your people.” These folks are your future audience and grassroots publicists. You will be successful if you analyze what motivates your people and tailor your crowdfunding campaign to them. From the words you use and the visuals on your page to the video appeal and rewards, each element needs to help excite and motivate them. Filmmaker Tracy Heather Strain shares what she learned from studying successful crowdfunding campaigns and how she applied this audience-focused approach to her own $100,000 Kickstarter campaign. Maria Agui Carter: Vision Accomplished Beyond technology, training and tutorials, it is storytelling with a unique voice and vision that connects you to audiences and helps your work stand out.  How to cultivate your authentic, and original voice and personal mission to thrive in the film world. Anna Feder: Finding your Village: Creating Community Around Your First Film We all hear stories about filmmaking teams that come out of the graduating classes from Tisch, UCLA and USC. But what if you didn’t go to film school? How do you connect with talented people who will work on your project for free and really champion your vision? A middle age filmmaker long out of school shares her experience making her first film fueled by love and a family of kindred media makers.

239|Mar 11, 2019|500 E Cesar Chavez Austin, TX, EUA|The Future is Functional, Nootropics In Your Daily Life|4:30pm|3:30pm|Austin Convention Center Trade Show - Next Stage - Exhibit Hall 4|Many of the present energy-providing drink products and supplements focus mainly on high caffeine levels to provide the consumer with a boost of energy. There are many known upsides, but also downsides.  It’s not news that caffeine has side effects. Caffeine initially stimulates your body to produce more adrenaline and dopamine than usual, two substances in your body that contribute to energy and a positive mood; when these chemicals begin to drop again, you can experience fading energy and a drop in mood, also known as the crash-and-burn effect. We ask ourselves how this affects people when confronted with mentally challenging problems? We believe in using supplements that contributes to a more steady stream of energy and long-term build-up to avoid crash-and-burn effect.  Consumers today are increasingly more aware and knowledgeable of supplements and nutrition. More conscious about what they consume and how those products affect their body and performance.There are many different supplements that affects the human body, both physically and psychologically. We would like to address some of them, more specifically: nootropic ingredients. Nootropics is an umbrella term for cognitive enhancers that e.g. increase focus, memory or other mental aspects. We believe that  the decrease in growth of the energy drinks market is partially related to the growing health trend. Nootropics has had an annual market growth of 20%, but we think that this trend is only starting.  How can these ingredients help todays consumers and their behaviour in both productivity but also, wellbeing?  What is even more important, how do we address the consumers long-term energy requirements and building up the “right” type of energy? Instead of focusing on reactionary behaviour, we’d like to speak about the benefits of planned consumption.  Programming descriptions are generated by participants and do not necessarily reflect the opinions of SXSW.|30.2642649|-97.7392938

More and more, agencies are inserting themselves at nearly every level of the Hollywood food chain. They are becoming full-fledged media companies and are integrally involved in the ideation, creation, and distribution of film and television content. While this has created new revenue streams for the agencies and their talent, it has also become confusing, and occasionally unsettling, to many people in the industry and has created many potential conflicts of interest. This panel of sales, finance and producing agents will discuss the new paradigm for Hollywood agencies, the advantages and concerns, and what it means for the future of the talent agency.

Adverse to traditional methods of advertising, who do they trust? Influencers. 92% of consumers believe that their recommendations are more authentic than an ad. For this reason, brands are humanizing their marketing campaigns with these key opinion leaders.  So, what will influencer marketing look like in 2025? A 2018 study showed that just 9% of Gen-Z uses Facebook, will social platforms like these continue to be relevant? As the demand for influencer campaigns surpasses advertising, we predict a shift towards automating the campaign process -- from discovery, to campaign tracking and measurement. A network of micro-influencers will replace single brand ambassadors, and attaining authenticity will become top priority.Programming descriptions are generated by participants and do not necessarily reflect the opinions of SXSW.|30.2642649|-97.7392938
254|Mar 12, 2019|500 E Cesar Chavez Austin, TX, EUA|RENOVATING DEMOCRACY: A New Framework for Governance|10:30am|9:30am|Austin Convention Center Room 9ABC|The rise of populism in the West and the rise of China in the East have stirred a rethinking of how democratic systems work—and how they fail. The impact of globalism and digital capitalism is forcing worldwide attention to the starker divide between the “haves” and the “have-nots,” challenging how we think about the social contract. In this session, Berggruen Institute founders and coauthors of Renovating Democracy: Governing in the Age of Globalization and Digital Capitalism,  Nicolas Berggruen and Nathan Gardels will discuss their alternative framework for governance with fierce clarity and conviction. To truly renovate our global systems, the authors argue for empowering participation without populism by integrating social networks and direct democracy into the system with new mediating institutions that complement representative government. They will discuss their plan to reconfigure the social contract to protect workers instead of jobs, shifting from a “redistribution” after wealth to “pre-distribution” with the aim to enhance the skills and assets of those less well-off. Lastly, they’ll call for harnessing globalization through “positive nationalism” at home while advocating for global cooperation—specifically through a partnership with China to create a viable rules-based world order.

Even with such compulsive overproduction of the images of ourselves, we might end up with nothing but the blank memories of our past. Even the data on ourselves will eventually fade away… The installation consists of a display that prompts you to take a selfie on your phone, which it renders in digital particles on a large 1×1 meter screen. Then a moment later, your face scatters and falls apart and the real black gravel starts to fall at the bottom of the screen in perfect synchrony with the digital simulation. Gradually, a dark mound builds up at the foot of the construction.

Companies are falling like flies. Entire industries are starting to wobble as a result of the seismic forces of change, disruptive effect of technology and destabilizing force from startups. Corporations have themselves to blame. As the saying goes, “let’s see how big we can get until we suck.” Mission accomplished. Corporations that once graced the Fortune 500 are now causalities of war. They’ve become too bureaucratic; too political; too dysfunctional; too risk averse and as a result, have lost their competitive edge. And if you expected good news or a happy ending, there may not be one. That doesn’t mean we can’t try. In this book reading, Jaffe will offer a path to redemption, but with full warning, it may be too late.

Our devices will change dramatically and change us in ways no one can fully predict. Convergence tells the story of Augmented Reality, a new technology that’s seeping into every smartphone and every workplace. But the smartphone is just the beginning. We will soon wonder how we put up with its miserable form for so long. In this presentation of key ideas from his new book, author and Forbes columnist Charlie Fink will discuss how the convergence will lead to head-worn, interoperable AR/VR glasses and, ultimately, to wearable, invisible, computing. The book uses a kind of AR called ""marker AR,"" to allow readers to use their smartphone to bring pages to life in surprising and entertaining ways to illustrate how the world, and everyone it, will be painted with data.

This morphed into a photography series “Strong is the New Pretty,” which went viral in 2015, a 2017 book by the same name, and has led to collaborations with brands such as Kellogg’s, American Express, Disney and Athleta. Parker’s new book, The Heart of a Boy: Celebrating the Strength and Spirit of Boyhood, helps positively redefine masculinity at a moment when the country is focused on how to raise our boys to become good people. Through her work both with brands and as a professional photographer and former advertising producer and writer, Parker aims to inspire both boys and girls to be their best selves - to challenge and test their limits, to nurture their curiosity and intellect, to find strength in being creative and kind, and to accept the multitudes contained within themselves. It is this perspective that she brings to her work with brands, helping them find an authentic, unexpected, and disruptive vision that will resonate with consumers by challenging their expectations of what it means to be masculine and feminine in today's world.

That’s not the case anymore. Misrepresentation, exaggerated truths, and outright fake news have become a world-wide phenomenon. Finding truth in today's world is only getting harder. As we move to a future dominated by artificial intelligence, where cars drive us better than we can drive ourselves and robots become our managers, who we trust and how we build businesses, engage customers, and motivate employees (real or artificially created ones) is going to be markedly different. Drawing upon principles from psychology, real-world business experiences and with a peek into some of the technology advances taking place in innovation hotspots like Silicon Valley, Shiv Singh will explore what we all need to do to engage consumers and build their trust in the future.

In this workshop, based on a simplified version I've taught online, we'll be exploring the process of learning to speak in a brand's language while quickly exploring story concepts. We'll be taking apart brand guidelines and then using that information to learn to speak the brand language of the company. With that data, we'll come up with ideas for simple channel identities for a cable network. Using available and provided props, we'll quickly film our concepts in the area around the class, see how well they work, then bring everything back and edit the films into finished pieces. By the end, each student team will have a couple of polished small 5-second channel bumpers. Students should have a phone that can film and a way to edit.Programming descriptions are generated by participants and do not necessarily reflect the opinions of SXSW.|30.2642649|-97.7392938

Indeed, even the creative industries have been impacted. But the dialogue about AI for creative activities doesn’t have to be one of conflict and replacement.  Recently, music technologists are using AI to extend what humans can do musically - to foster collaboration, to create rapid musical prototypes, and to create new modes of music consumption. Two pioneers in this field are the companies Landr and Melodrive. Landr uses AI to automatically master musical tracks, but also enables users to collaborate, share and promote their music. Melodrive is creating an AI that composes - and re-composes - music, so that it can be truly adaptive.

Branding to Win in a “Brand” New World|4:30pm|3:30pm|Austin Convention Center Room 9ABC|Why do some brand-customer relationships endure, and others don't? In human relationships, there are scientific reasons why relationships go south when one of the partners trades the rose colored glasses in for sweatpants. The same is true for brands. Deb Gabor shares highlights from her new book: IRRATIONAL LOYALTY. BUILDING A BRAND THAT THRIVES IN TURBULENT TIMES, examining: ·      How the practices of branding and marketing changed forever with the 2016 election and Trump’s current presidency ·      Why every brand needs to “show up” with a set of values and beliefs to attract their “ideal” customers ·      Where good branding intentions can go off the rails ·      How brands can create a solid foundation that equips them to endure every kind of brand crisis they could imagine, and even the ones they can’t (think Papa John’s and its founder, John Schnatter) ·      Why some brands can not only endure – but create – controversy and use it to their advantage (Nike, Dick’s Sporting Goods, Starbucks.) Using ripped-from-the-headlines examples, Deb Gabor delves into why the most authentic brands with the strongest core brand DNA can weather even the most tumultuous relationships with their customers … and why some are doomed to always struggle.

288|Mar 12, 2019|500 E Cesar Chavez Austin, TX, EUA|Why The World Needs a Rock Photography Museum|4:30pm|3:30pm|Austin Convention Center Trade Show - Next Stage - Exhibit Hall 4|The cultural impact of rock and roll is undeniable - aftershocks from the initial quake in the 60s and 70s ripple out to this day, over a half century later. The companion piece to this musical legacy is the photography that both documented and promoted it. It’s the visual yang to the sonic yin. When you think of ‘The Beatles’ what comes into your mind first, a sound or a picture? The audio portion of rock and roll is well preserved; the visual, less so. The imagery, from the 60s and 70s in particular, was captured primarily by freelancers. A few were able to become legends in their own right and their work is treated accordingly. The archives of the rest are literally scattered all over the planet in home offices, attics, garages and basements. The youngest of these artists is in their late 60s, the future of their work often in question. Our vision of the Rock Photography Museum is of an institution that will preserve, promote and present the photographic legacy of rock and roll: preserve through the proper storage and archiving of the physical material; promote the work through book and film projects and licensing to third parties; present in the form of regular exhibitions in a permanent, physical space so that the public can enjoy the work in a museum type setting.

Its central argument is that the cultural practices of hip-hop culture are the blueprint to the 21st century, and that an understanding of its appropriation of language and technology is an understanding of the now. Emerging alongside cyberpunk in the 1980s, the hallmarks of hip-hop — allusion, self-reference, the use of new technologies, sampling, the cutting and splicing of language and sound — would come to define the culture of the new millennium.

Even with such compulsive overproduction of the images of ourselves, we might end up with nothing but the blank memories of our past. Even the data on ourselves will eventually fade away… The installation consists of a display that prompts you to take a selfie on your phone, which it renders in digital particles on a large 1×1 meter screen. Then a moment later, your face scatters and falls apart and the real black gravel starts to fall at the bottom of the screen in perfect synchrony with the digital simulation. Gradually, a dark mound builds up at the foot of the construction.

It's a Work of Arts|1:30pm|12:30pm|Austin Convention Center Room 11AB|Consumers have never been more informed or selective. As we grow future audiences for the world’s leading performing arts organization (with 6.5M annual visitors), it’s a priority to ensure Lincoln Center remains relevant—and relay this value to young, highly curatorial audiences.  As a nonprofit, our strategy must be lean—yet uphold our position as a major economic engine for NYC (contributing $2.4B annually). We rely on support from ticket-buyers/donors—while interactions with and expectations of entertainment are fast-changing. Two pilot studies—on audience segmentation and performance metrics—chart a promising path for organizations to significantly connect with young audiences: by diversifying programming, improving access, and customizing outreach to targeted demographics.

316|Mar 13, 2019|500 E Cesar Chavez Austin, TX, EUA|Understanding Stage Fright|12:45pm|12:30pm|Austin Convention Center Room 13AB|Countless musicians and performing artists are familiar with the unwelcome effects of performance anxiety, also known as stage fright. Whether it happens at random or all of the time, performance anxiety has prevented many artists from utilizing their full performing capacity. It’s disruptive, it crushes dreams, it sometimes ends careers. It is easier to believe that one lacks talent than it is to observe how personal experiences have directly affected one’s natural learning process and ability to perform. Whether a performer is simply excited, derailed by unforeseen events, or shut down by feelings of shame or isolation, there is a way back to confidence. The goal of this session is to provide a starting point from which artists may work through their own experiences of performance anxiety.

Free from doubt, prejudice, and social norms, you experienced life fully and deeply through all five senses—unencumbered by limits or boundaries. Through this embodied discovery using sight, sound, taste, touch, and smell, fully engaged, you transformed into who you have become. Bruce Mau, legendary designer of human experience, invites you to revisit this time. ‘Designing for the Five Senses’ is a challenge for us all to use design to iterate and improve the world. In this groundbreaking monologue – part performance art, part manifesto, part storytelling, and 100% multi-sensory immersion – you will reconnect with heart, mind, and memory through an orchestrated tour of all your senses that will transport you back to a time when you were discovering the world. Ignite the wisdom of our shared past of discovery and boundless possibility. Emerge inspired, reminded that the beauty of our universal humanity always was, already is, and still has time to be. Bruce Mau is a brilliantly creative optimist whose love of thorny problems led him to create a methodology for whole system transformation. Bruce has successfully applied his design thinking methodology to economic, cultural, governmental, environmental, and social change projects. Believing that a multi-sensory live brand experience is the most influential medium we could possibly imagine, Bruce serves as Chief Design Officer of Freeman to hone the transformative power of design thinking and drive innovation throughout the events industry.

319|Mar 13, 2019|500 E Cesar Chavez Austin, TX, EUA|Das Body|1:40pm|1:00pm|International Day Stage Austin Convention Center|Out of the greyer climes of Oslo— particularly East Oslo with its drizzly expanse of apartment blocks and gas stations stocked with Kent cigs and smut mags— has suddenly come a burst of color by the name of Das Body. Ellie, Kim, Patrik, Didrik— all four were born and bred in Norway and have become fast friends making music that is listenably and undeniably pop, though just a little iffier— pop that feels like a newly-thrifted favorite T-shirt: comfortably worn, slightly sunfaded, and with a cigarette burn on its sleeve. Das Body is writing pop music without the sentimentality that oversweetens so much currently on radio rotation. Instead, to their vulnerability, they mix in a little vulgarity, or a little light-heartedness. After a few years deep in the studio, they have now emerged with already plenty of buzz from local fests and press, and their debut EP released in September 2018 on Luminelle Recordings. Das Body brings a uniquely Nordic odd-pop that is, nonetheless, destined for charts the world over.

Trying to pin the Bristol trio’s sound down is pointless because the usual pop rules don’t apply. Textures matter as much as melodies. Genres bend and blend. Electronics rub shoulders with odd instruments. Katy Sargent sings as though casting a spell. The Omnitone Collection, Elder Island’s extraordinary debut album, boasts ten tracks that are rich tapestries of tiny moments in time, but also sweeping soundtracks riven with ambition. They are songs to lose yourself in, to be swept away by, to send shivers up your spine. Formed six years ago as an experiment-come-university hobby, Elder Island are singer and cellist Katy, bassist and beats maker Luke Thornton and guitarist and synth wizard David Havard. None hail from Bristol, but the city was what brought them together and its genre-mashing scene was what inspired them to start Elder Island. The trio of Four Tet fans started out with jam sessions at home, adding weird percussion to Luke’s loops and stitching field recordings in to their soundscapey songs.

Even with such compulsive overproduction of the images of ourselves, we might end up with nothing but the blank memories of our past. Even the data on ourselves will eventually fade away… The installation consists of a display that prompts you to take a selfie on your phone, which it renders in digital particles on a large 1×1 meter screen. Then a moment later, your face scatters and falls apart and the real black gravel starts to fall at the bottom of the screen in perfect synchrony with the digital simulation. Gradually, a dark mound builds up at the foot of the construction.

They influenced other women artists, and some actively empowered others.

Cruising between dream pop and alternative rock, and taking their inspiration from a box where Martin Gore, Damon Albarn, Jonny Greenwood, and Mylene Farmer are having lunch together, Chkbns pursue an elusive mission (being well aware of the impossibility of this mission) of finding an equivalent of things one never sees or hears but yet experiences. The trio performed their songs live on KEXP, at Canadian Music Week, Reeperbahn Festival and Stereoleto (headlined by Franz Ferdinand and Cigarettes After Sex). Independently and together with various showcases, Chkbns toured around Europe and Asia, visiting such cities as Stockholm, London, Hong Kong, Seoul, Shanghai, and Beijing. So far - 3 self-released EPs have come out. They are: Eat Sleep Mom Dad, Private Fiction & This Time. Currently, Chkbns’ first full-length album is at the final stage.

How are A&R teams using metrics to make recommendations to roster artists on their labels for future songs/albums? Do streaming music economics allow labels and publishers to take more chances with artists?

Whether being accused of leaving the DIY punk scene to pursue a major label career over a decade ago, or courageously challenging people's conceptions of gender identity with a bombshell Rolling Stone article, Grace has remained a daring and influential cultural figure in her over 20+ years of creating dynamic art across various mediums. Sure, she’s bound to worry some fans with her decision to press pause on Against Me! to release a more intimate singer-songwriter leaning solo album under the name Laura Jane Grace & the Devouring Mothers, but her artistic motivation cast her determination in steel.Programming descriptions are generated by participants and do not necessarily reflect the opinions of SXSW.|30.2642649|-97.7392938

The next big opportunity for streaming is to become the future of radio, which incidentally is around double the size of the recorded music market. It will be a classic case of disruptive insurgents stealing market share from long-standing incumbents who will not bow out of the race quietly.

447|Mar 14, 2019|500 E Cesar Chavez Austin, TX, EUA|Ferris & Sylvester|3:10pm|2:30pm|Flatstock Stage Austin Convention Center|Ferris & Sylvester are songwriters - With clear references in their catchy setup to the mid-60s sounds of Greenwich Village combined with their meatier blues tones, the pair sit somewhere between Jack White and First Aid Kit. Their clever combination of blues, folk and rock n roll has created a distinctive genre of their own. The London-based pair met almost three years ago and have since won over the capital with their ever-growing live presence and songwriting. In 2018, the duo released their highly anticipated EP 'Made In Streatham' which they self-produced in their South London flat. Released through their own label 'Archtop Records', the EP has clocked up millions of plays on Spotify and received widespread praise across the board.  After a monumental year of touring in 2018, F&S now stand poised and ready to launch into the new year as proudly independent songwriters and performers. With their eyes fixed on building up to their debut album, the duo have expanded their sound into a deeper and darker body of work. ‘A rich and fully realised sound that leaves one pining for a full-length.’ – Rolling Stone Magazine Programming descriptions are generated by participants and do not necessarily reflect the opinions of SXSW.|30.2642649|-97.7392938

A song can see an organic spike in streaming attention at any point in time, for whatever reason. The trick is to identify that a spike is happening, understand who is listening and reach that audience in real time. This presentation will explore how adopting a reactive marketing strategy versus one planned in advance using automatic tools can boost catalogue sales.  It is very challenging to use data to break or re-establish a hit record if you can't quantify what you are trying to achieve. This presentation will also explore a new type of Hit Model that takes into account genre, city and stage of an artist.

This includes use of songs in Hollywood blockbuster movies or independent productions, in Netflix, Amazon or Hulu limited series, traditional TV network and cable dramas and music-centric shows, even in console or mobile video games. But with these increased opportunities has come many changes in the licensing process, deal structures, negotiating tactics, upfront fees and “backend” royalties - and that’s true for both pre-exiting songs and sound recordings or new songs written specifically for the project.

But that’s exactly where Apre’s story begins.     Charlie Brown and Jules Konieczny were no strangers to making music individually, but it wasn’t until Sue who runs Ealing chess club (or, to use her full title “this legend called Sue”) suggested they should hook up and work together that the strands that make up Apre’s unique sound started to fuse together.   “She knew that we shared this passion for music and she paired us up,” recalls Brown, “we started playing together and found this love for the same thing.”   However, things didn’t quite immediately leap forwards from that moment to where we are today.

512|Mar 15, 2019|500 E Cesar Chavez Austin, TX, EUA|SXSW Art Program Presents hash2ash by panGenerator, Krzysztof Cybulski, Krzysztof Goliński, Jakub Koźniewski |6:00pm|11:00am|Austin Convention Center Room 10C|The installation touches on the themes of selfie-culture, and the fear of permanently losing the digital records of our lives due to technical failures, impermanence of data storage, or simply because of the obsolescence of the old digital file formats. Even with such compulsive overproduction of the images of ourselves, we might end up with nothing but the blank memories of our past. Even the data on ourselves will eventually fade away… The installation consists of a display that prompts you to take a selfie on your phone, which it renders in digital particles on a large 1×1 meter screen. Then a moment later, your face scatters and falls apart and the real black gravel starts to fall at the bottom of the screen in perfect synchrony with the digital simulation. Gradually, a dark mound builds up at the foot of the construction.

For example, a listener can now simply ask their device to “play some Indie Rock”, and in doing so, they expect to hear Indie Rock music. But what are they really expecting here? What is “Indie Rock”? What isn’t “Indie Rock”? How can we expect machines to accurately understand musical genres when these labels are not always clear to us humans? In this talk, Evan Paul will discuss the challenges that both humans and machines face when attempting to classify music and how these challenges will shape the future of personalized music recommendations.

How did this happen? What can we do about it? This presentation will confront the complex and often contradictory politics of punk songs, symbols, and representations of race and sexuality, drawing on Cornell University’s extensive punk rock archive of flyers, zines, posters, t-shirts, and ephemera. I will discuss archival materials from the Sex Pistols, Crass, the Germs, Wasted Youth, Crucifix, Atrocity, as well as Austin’s own MDC and the Dicks, among others, to show how punk history can be a tool for political conversation and engagement in the present.

Some designers might think that this knowledge is not easy to apply, or even fear that it will distort the experience they intend to offer. However, UX and cognitive science combined are at the service of design, and can provide very concrete and easy-to-use tips to anticipate and solve design problems, sometimes even before the play testing phase. By having a general understanding of how the brain works and by following UX guidelines, the designers increase the chance of their audience experiencing the intended design. This talk will offer an introduction to UX and psychology in game development, with examples from Fortnite.Programming descriptions are generated by participants and do not necessarily reflect the opinions of SXSW.|30.2642649|-97.7392938

The Sydney quartet explode their emotions into a musical kaleidoscope, finding catharsis in the ethereal bliss of pop’s plastic, proggy past. At the core of it all is dedication to timeless songwriting. Over the past few years, six consecutive singles have been added to high rotation on Australia's national radio broadcaster Triple J, accompanied by sold out shows around the country and appearances at festivals such as Laneway and Lost Paradise.  In August 2018 the band released the single 'Landmine', which has truly been the outfit's biggest statement to date. Indicative of the lofty ambition inherent in their debut album, 'Love Is A Landmine', slated for release in  2019, ""Landmine"" marks a new beginning for the band. It revels in shimmering 70's soft rock glory but it is the channeling of this influence into something exotic and new that has truly dazzled audiences. Released in February 2019, their follow up single ""Heather"" has people predicting that I Know Leopard's album will be one of the breakthrough Australian releases of the year.

The album will contain all original songs produced by Wyclef, but will feature students from each of the schools visited either as musicians, side artists, etc. Through this project, Wyclef is striving to create a platform for undiscovered musicians and artists with raw talent who may not have millions of views on YouTube or followers on Social Media.

What emerged was their unique and experimental sound.  In 2018, My Life as Ali Thomas has been focusing on creating new material and ‘Daydreaming’, their highly anticipated first single since 2016’s album ‘Paper’, will be released in November 2018, with a follow up single in early 2019. ‘Daydreaming’ is an evolution of the band’s signature sound, incorporating the 90s pop influences with their signature ambient, folk-rock sound.

Cities around the world are competing for talent, employers, & growth, are fighting climate change, supporting diversity and working to enhance the health and wellbeing of their citizens and voters; music can be at the heart of all these issues. Rarely, however, is music included in these debates, though it remains a unifying, global tool to make cities better across a number of issues.

Even with such compulsive overproduction of the images of ourselves, we might end up with nothing but the blank memories of our past. Even the data on ourselves will eventually fade away… The installation consists of a display that prompts you to take a selfie on your phone, which it renders in digital particles on a large 1×1 meter screen. Then a moment later, your face scatters and falls apart and the real black gravel starts to fall at the bottom of the screen in perfect synchrony with the digital simulation. Gradually, a dark mound builds up at the foot of the construction.

Fans of Elliot Smith, Death Cab for Cutie, and Alvin & The Chipmunks might gravitate towards Big Phony’s sound.  Catch him in the 2019 music feature film “Fiction & Other Realties” loosely based on his life as a sad singer-songwriter. He currently resides in Seoul, Korea. “...be sure not to miss South Korea’s Big Phony. You may have heard of the bubblegum K-pop that is ubiquitous in most of Asia but what about K-indie? Big Phony sounds like a Korean Elliott Smith with tunes like ""I Love Lucy"" and ""Girls Like You Don't Go For Guys Like Me"" - his melancholy lyrics and quiet, gifted way with chord changes.” ~ Alan Miller, Culture Collide/Filter Magazine ""Korea’s Bobby Choy, an appealing folk singer who performs as Big Phony, was born in New York. He said that when he relocated to Seoul, the indie musicians in the Hongdae area knew well the music of Nick Drake and Elliott Smith, his major influences.” ~ Jim Fusilli, Wall Street Journal Programming descriptions are generated by participants and do not necessarily reflect the opinions of SXSW."|30.2642649|-97.7392938

Recent research in neuroscience has found that our brains group musical rhythms similar to how we hear patterns in language. This insight can help us reimagine how we teach and learn music utilizing what we already know about language and vice versa. In this session, Adam Neely will utilize Youtube clips to demonstrate how our brains perceive rhythm in language and music by transcribing patterns of speech taken from videos and turning them into musical notation that he will perform live on his bass.  Part music lesson, part neurolinguistic experiment; this session is meant to illustrate how we can learn music the same way we learn language, and that artists can discover musical inspiration from unlikely sources.

In its abstract form it evokes the human relation through its behavior. The viewer is invited to suspend their predispositions about AI, and engage with it in an explorative, curious way.

This panel gathers experts to explore parallels between the #MeToo and Equal Pay movements, particularly how silence and sector norm further injustice. This panel will also explore what social structures, mindsets, and practices lead to pay inequity; how individuals, companies, and systems can begin to move toward equity; and key tactics to engage leaders and peers toward transparency and parity.Programming descriptions are generated by participants and do not necessarily reflect the opinions of SXSW.|30.2645713|-97.74319799999999

But sports media is seeing a larger, less discussed trend: Rights holders are leaving cable for OTT. This is the domino that’ll topple traditional sports media. While OTT previously catered to rights holders that didn’t receive revenue to broadcast their events or who paid for linear distribution,  today, governing bodies have moved entire schedules to OTT -- getting more value than ever before for their event rights. As the dominos of sports like wrestling and gymnastics tumble, mainstream sports are lining up their move. We’ll look 5 years ahead, with OTT players and rights holders exploring how the migration of rights deals will impact cable programming and spur a breakdown in sports consumption.

In particular during election times, social media platforms have been used to strategically to influence public opinion – from the Philippines, to Kenya, from Germany to the USA.

History dismissed women’s health concerns as “hysteria”; today, women still struggle to get clear answers about their fertility, receive low value pregnancy care, experience bias if they are black or brown, poor, rural, lesbian or transgender, and are cast aside by our healthcare system as new mothers. In a self-examining view, this panel features three young Ob/Gyns who will take you under the hood to share why women are turning away from their doctors and towards other kinds of solutions.

Parental leave policies in the US remain some of the worst in the world:  inadequate, according to reporting by Haley Swenson of Slate.com. Swenson will explain the policy and economic landscape in which progress on pregnancy-related discrimination has stalled. OBGYN Dr. Adam Wolfberg will explain clinical limits pregnancy places (or doesn’t place) on work, and business school professor Danna Greenberg will explain how leading companies help their best employees succeed at home and at work - and simultaneously improve culture and profits.

These videos appear to show news events, or public figures speaking, and seem to be published by legitimate news outlets. However, they are in fact highly sophisticated AI-driven video forgeries. This session explores what strategies and technologies news outlets and consumers should be adopting to defend themselves against this frightening new development.Programming descriptions are generated by participants and do not necessarily reflect the opinions of SXSW.|30.2645713|-97.74319799999999

But reporting on the realities that exist between the coasts requires more than just parachuting into the Heartland. There are stories to be told, and perspectives to be unpacked, that can only come from reporters who live in these communities. Hear four journalists, who live and work in rural America, discuss the issues that matter to their neighbors (hint: it may not be what you think), and their strategies for covering those stories with a sensitivity to both local sentiment and to the larger national debate about this moment in American politics.

But despite better gender equality in sports participation, the media coverage of women’s sports is out of step — with potentially devastating consequences. When research of women’s sports in media began, women rarely appeared in sports news coverage, except to be portrayed as sex objects or the butt of a joke. Over time, that overt sexism has been replaced by a general absence of women altogether, or limited resources being devoted to the coverage. SIDELINED: WOMEN'S SPORTS IN MASS MEDIA will discuss the ways women athletes are represented (and misrepresented) across a variety of channels including film, sports news, and new media — and offer actionable solutions for better representation.

But it’s possible to be too nice, failing to disagree when we need to or surface new ideas or innovations. In fact, in some companies, “I don’t agree” is the same as saying “You’re an idiot.” You can’t have a diverse, inclusive, productive team without some healthy fights. In this session, we’ll talk about how teams can smartly tackle uncomfortable conversations and disagreements and how managers have an obligation to design conflicts that allow their teams to be creative and productive. We’ll explore how to make it OK for people to dissent, debate, and express their true opinions. We’ll look at case studies of disagreements that have gone wrong and talk about ways to fix them.

809|Mar 8, 2019|110 E 2nd St. Austin, TX, EUA|The Social Service Business Case for Healthcare|1:30pm|12:30pm|JW Marriott Salon FG|The impact of Social Determinants Of Health (SDOH) as drivers of medical utilization, cost, and health outcomes is widely researched and acknowledged. Evidence suggests that as much as 40% of health outcomes are related to SDOH such as housing, education, poverty, nutrition and loneliness.  Despite widespread acknowledgment of the importance of addressing SDOH to improve outcomes and lower costs, investments in SDOH tend to be modest in scale and temporary. Over the course of a year, KPMG and the Commonwealth Fund researched how to accelerate the integration of services to address social needs into healthcare business operations. Though the perception is that it can take 5-7 years to see ROI for spending on social services, we created a guide for how to obtain ROI within 12-18 months.

In this session, you will learn from Emmy-winning producer of both traditional sports and eSports behemoth League of Legends, Ariel Horn; broadcast talent from both traditional sports (formerly of ESPN) and Madden League, Adrienne Lawrence; and NFL veteran and current video game streamer, Chad ""Ocho Cinco"" Johnson, as they share their unique perspectives particularly on the out of arena viewer experience.Programming descriptions are generated by participants and do not necessarily reflect the opinions of SXSW."|30.2645713|-97.74319799999999

The U.S. has the highest rate of deaths related to pregnancy and childbirth in the developed world. Half of these deaths are preventable, victimizing women from a variety of races, backgrounds and income levels. The spotlight on this issue has led groups to start working on solutions at community, healthcare and policy levels.

Burnout, its severity and prevalence, was the stand-out issue in recent research from the Reuters Institute, University of Oxford – and everyone is at risk, from CEO to intern. This panel drills down into this issue. How can journalists project their health and sanity in a scoop-driven 24/7 world, and where the media itself is under concerted attack? Does their own commitment to the field and addiction technology contribute? Are pressures to perform and adapt even higher for those with diverse backgrounds?

Hiring women, promoting women, paying women equally and stopping harassment is getting all the right kind of press. Finally. But while we’re thrilled to celebrate the empowerment of women, we’re ignoring a prevalent practice that can be seen daily in many workplaces: women putting and keeping other women down.

So the implementation of natural interaction, including voice, will potentially benefit 1.4 billion users.

The need for disruption in health care delivery has never been greater. Successful health care organizations must create a system that relies on care coordination, evidence-based medicine, social determinants of health and value.

They want every patient encounter with an emergency department to be noticed. They want the sickest patients, the five percent who add up to 80 percent of costs, to get support to live healthier lives. For this to happen, patient health data needs to be unlocked from silos and exchanged between facilities in real-time.

Estimates are that 5% of us bet regularly creating an industry with revenues up to $400bn. But since 1992 sports betting was ILLEGAL in most states of the USA.  In May 2018 SCOTUS changed all that and said states can decide for themselves if sports betting is allowed. States have reacted quickly with 8 states legalising betting and 15 more in the process of regulating. Regulated, and transparent, betting will reveal previously hidden scandals. The money coming in will change how we consume and engage with sports. The media and advertising landscape will dramatically alter to the demands of sports betting. Sports will be more entertaining. Legalised betting will change professional and college sports nationwide forever.

And yet, in spite of our advances, millennials are on track to be the first generation to live shorter lives than their parents.  Why?  Because the things that make us sick today (diabetes, high blood pressure, obesity, loneliness, suicide, and substance use disorders) are not solved with the pills, devices, and procedures that have been the traditional focus of medical care.  These conditions are solved by durable behavior change and effective social interventions, delivered through meaningful relationships with professional caregivers that will only come from prioritizing interpersonal medicine. Join these speakers as they discuss ways to make this shift. Programming descriptions are generated by participants and do not necessarily reflect the opinions of SXSW.|30.2645713|-97.74319799999999

The Maternal Wall is one of the more prevalent biases in our society, stemming from stereotypes that link women with the lack of competence and commitment once they have children. Research shows that women with children are 79% less likely to be hired; 50% less likely to be promoted; make 20% less in salary for the same position; and held to higher performance standards than their peers. How do we disrupt these paradigms, shift mindset, and architect innovative solutions to better support our modern moms?

But what we’re really discussing here is privilege. See, it’s one thing to spot and share a trend with your clients or the world. But as designers and consultants, we have a much greater responsibility than that. People have an uncanny ability to change or impact things for the worse. But if we can actively confront our own privilege as it creeps into our trend-spotting and our professional advice to clients, who trust us to make and remake their businesses, we might be able to change the world – for the better.

In the U.S. alone, in 30 states you can be fired for being LGBTQ. As a result, LGBT people increasingly rely on encryption to lead their lives free of fear from discrimination and prosecution. Efforts to force providers to build in “back doors” that allow unfettered access to data create a chilling effect on LGBT people in the US and around the world. Law enforcement agencies have legitimate need for obtaining data but there needs to be limits on how such data is collected.  We discuss current efforts to weaken encryption protections in the US and present a balanced analysis of the need for access to data versus the privacy cost such efforts entail.

In 2018, McKinsey & Company correlated the financial data and design actions of 300 companies over 5 years.

Penalties and mandated trainings have had little effect. Ingrained behaviors in many company cultures have prohibited women from getting into positions of leadership, and created an environment that many find intolerable. There needs to be a seismic shift in the way that sexual harassment is handled. In this panel discussion, HR and technology leaders discuss a 4-step remedy: 1) Creating an open network for authentic 2-way dialogue, so that people can safely share their views, 2) Offering better education across the board, 3) Convincing leadership to own the issue, and 4) Creating a culture of mutual respect, trust, and transparency, in which there is zero tolerance for harassment.Programming descriptions are generated by participants and do not necessarily reflect the opinions of SXSW.|30.2645713|-97.74319799999999

Since the Supreme Court ruled that LGBTQ people have the same right to marry as everyone else, opponents of equality are aggressively pursuing strategies to reclaim the ground they’ve lost. They have pivoted to “religious liberty” as a cover for discrimination and to demonizing transgender people in their bid to reclaim the momentum. Their coordinated battle to turn back the clock is being fought in our workplaces, schools, hospitals, houses of worship, and--most of all--the court of public opinion. Join us to learn about the emerging threats to equality and what straight, cisgender allies can do to stand with queer people in the workplace and beyond.

While AI is already an integrated part of our lives, it often exists as intangible systems working behind screens. In Semeion, the AI manifests itself in several large minimalist structures, that individually and collectively respond to human presence. In its abstract form it evokes the human relation through its behavior. The viewer is invited to suspend their predispositions about AI, and engage with it in an explorative, curious way.

News organizations—both print and digital—are contracting. And it’s getting harder and harder for companies to reach anyone through conventional PR. Today, companies are searching for new ways to to reach and talk with customers. The result: The rise of brand as publisher.

Our systems of promotion and advancement are broken - women don’t need “fixing” - our workplace culture does. Men have an important role to play as allies in fixing those systems and there are simple steps men and companies can take to bring everyone along on the path to a more equal future. From equalization of parental leave to equal representation in the boardroom, male allies play an important role. This will be a lively discussion between a male equality champion and a female leader on how the two genders can work together to change our systems and elevate women at work.

Now, content is still king, but good content, meaningful, dynamic and insightful, is increasingly scarce. In  sports, we’ve gone from daily refresh (the newspaper) to hourly (SportsCenter) to more news, information and stories than anyone could possibly consume. Given that reality, how do we make sure we're telling the most compelling stories to cut through the noise? We bring together three master storytellers to pick their brains about why they tell the stories and what they do to ensure their vision cuts through the clutter.

Because CRISPR is also a revolution in how we as a species see our world, and ourselves. Suddenly the forces of evolution are ours to control. But where do we draw the line between hopeful medical advances and the dystopia of designer babies? And how do we make sure everyone can participate in a debate about what it means to be human?

It is changing the way fans consume content, the functionality of sports venues and possesses unlimited potential for development and revitalization. From former big-box retail stores to empty mall storefronts and beyond, esports can breathe new life into vacant spaces anywhere. Take Esports Stadium Arlington as an example. Currently the largest esports-specific venue in North America, it was built in an underutilized wing of the city’s convention center. Sports teams and cities will see benefits through new revenue streams, increased commerce and development and reinvigorated neighborhoods. Leaders from sports architecture firm Populous and esports event company NGAGE will explore esports’ development potential in this session.

But what you may not know is that it’s very much a health crisis as well: As physicians and health care providers warn us, America’s 11 million undocumented immigrants are often afraid to seek medical attention even when they direly need it, leading to soaring rates of mostly preventable diseases. This isn’t just a public health disaster, but an economic one as well, costing taxpayers millions in emergency medicine that could’ve been avoided with routine care. In this panel, health care professionals and immigration advocates will discuss ways to address this crisis and help the neediest among us stay healthy.

The alt-right, white supremacists, and more exploit a fragmented media landscape to spread hate, increase their ranks and viciously harass anyone who gets in their way. The challenges to monitoring and intervening are immense -- algorithmic manipulation of social media platforms allows bad actors to expand their reach and anonymous message boards and platforms largely shield their nefarious activity from the public. Leading experts will provide a framework for understanding the current information ecosystem, discuss developing new technology to serve as an early warning system for intervention, and ways the tech companies can fight back against the exploitation of their platforms.Programming descriptions are generated by participants and do not necessarily reflect the opinions of SXSW.|30.2645713|-97.74319799999999

We have the many corporate veterans hiring initiatives to thank for this; but, with 60 to 80% of veterans leaving their first post-military job before their second work anniversary we have to ask: Are these programs anything more than just a corporation’s way of saying “thank you for your service?” While hiring veterans is a step in the right direction, most companies aren’t prepared to help them transition from military service to civilian life. When you stop looking at hiring veterans as charity, and recognize the true business value they bring to an organization--great things happen--growth, success and changing of a national narrative.

918|Mar 9, 2019|110 E 2nd St. Austin, TX, EUA|Nature and Aesthetics: New Theories from Japan|4:30pm|3:30pm|JW Marriott Salon 5|From ancient days, Japanese culture viewed beauty as the assimilation of the practical and aesthetics, in other words, technology and art, which is reflected in everyday products. Called Wabi Sabi, it is a sophisticated view of finding beauty in nature through repeated efforts to stabilize the disparity between complexity and simplicity. According to media theory, when TV came into Japanese lives, mass media lulled the viewers into the mediocrity of middle class values, away from the refined perspective on nature. Now, with IoT and AI creating a totally computational and ultra-connected society, a new world that blends the artificial and nature evolves. We will take a look from the 1970’s to the present and present a new theory on nature through the point of view of a redefined Wabi Sabi.

While these tools advanced the practice of medicine, today’s technologies hold enormous promise for improving the health and well-being of countless lives. But what about the patient-physician relationship?

So how do we optimize innovations to sort hope from hype? This panel explores bridging the digital divide to improve the quality of health care, lower costs and make health care more human.

And because our data is valuable, there is an economic incentive to misuse it.  At times it feels like we’re living in a data dystopia. Palantir has developed “predictive policing” in New Orleans.  Your Roomba is mapping the layout of your home without you knowing it. AT&T is selling your web browsing history associated with your real name and address.   But we can use dystopia as a tool. Dystopia helps us imagine futures we don’t want to create and by reversal, the ones we truly do.

Many organizations today believe, without question, that all data is true and can tell a story on its own. But in fact, the cold reality of data is only helpful to a certain degree. Data alone rarely sheds light on the details of a consumer’s interaction with a brand. Did they enjoy it? Do they believe the brand’s story? Are they loyal? Data is in some ways easy because it’s clean and it’s simple. Empathy, on the other hand, is messy and difficult to understand. It’s up to us to interpret it and take meaning from it. That’s challenging as a designer, but by doing so, we create the most meaningful brand interactions. This session will explore what should come first when designing customer experiences today – the data or the feeling?

Our session aims to dispel common myths of over- and under-hyped AI predictions by offering two examples of startups who have developed healthcare applications of AI. IDx, the first company to obtain FDA clearance for an autonomous AI-based diagnostic, and 3Derm, a company navigating these regulatory waters, will teach the audience how to bring an algorithm out of the lab and into the marketplace without cutting corners or breaking the bank. Content will cover how to spot appropriate healthcare applications for AI, considerations to minimize algorithmic bias, and the future landscape of diagnostics.Programming descriptions are generated by participants and do not necessarily reflect the opinions of SXSW.|30.2645713|-97.74319799999999

We call these cognitive biases. Usually they’re harmless. Even helpful. But what happens when they’re not? In this talk I’ll use real-world examples to identify some particularly nasty biases that frequently lead users to make bad decisions. I'll then talk about some content strategy and design choices we can use in our apps, designs, and platforms to redirect or eliminate the impact of those biases. Finally, I'll explore our own biases as designers and some methods to prevent our own blind spots from hurting users.

Due to this, the world of aroma has traditionally borrowed its language from the other senses. Designing purely for the visual, however, engenders alienation. The collaborative panel between TEALEAVES, luxury tea blender, Microsoft Inclusive Design, 12.29, authority of olfactive branding, and Cooper Hewitt, Smithsonian Design Museum, will discuss how inclusive design principles can be used to create the language of aroma. The goal is to ultimately enhance the ability to receive information, explore the world, satisfy essential needs and experience joy and wonder through aroma.Programming descriptions are generated by participants and do not necessarily reflect the opinions of SXSW.|30.2645713|-97.74319799999999

When we’re born, one of the first things we do is receive care from a doctor. And when our lives come to an end, doctors are there again at our bedside. Yet, today that relationship has been degraded on many levels. From the endless choice that results in healthcare speed dating to often contentious relationship between doctors, patients, and payers.

Noise and distractions are the top complaints of office workers, and when people are unhappy, productivity drops. A lose-lose for individuals and the business. Not acceptable. So what if instead of trying the same old tactics to solve this noise epidemic we turn to nature for inspiration and make sound work for us, not against us. And in the process set an entirely new standard for what the open office experience should be – a place where humans thrive instead of suffer. This session addresses the basic principles of sound, the sight and sound link, the science behind natural elements, people and productivity, and technology that creates more adaptive, personalized and enjoyable workplace experiences.

Unfounded fear of immigration is on the rise, the #MeToo movement has garnered national attention, poll results regarding race relations have worsened. Diversity is an enigmatic topic of discussion that we contend is often utilized by organizations, news media, and in political dialogues without any true understanding of its meaning. As a result, opportunities for advancing diversity initiatives can backfire. This presentation will examine some commonly held misperceptions about work diversity, inclusion, and discrimination and unpack their myths and truths to highlight the complexity of managing the heterogeneous workforce of the future.Programming descriptions are generated by participants and do not necessarily reflect the opinions of SXSW.|30.2645713|-97.74319799999999

What if we built a model that treats the mind, heart, & soul and delivers cutting edge cancer therapies? What if we prioritize not just survival, but supporting patients' capability, comfort and calm?  What if we could use this model to improve access for ALL?

Although equality is what we continue to fight for, we don’t want to be homogenized into the greater public. This would make us less visible and less accessible to those seeking out their community. With the closing of lesbian bars, we need to pioneer the new movement that creates community without solely depending on a bar. This panel will discuss why it’s important to continue to create these spaces without having a brick and mortar location, and why the “temporary” separation is necessary. Last, we will discuss why cities with womxn focused events have a significantly higher attendance as a whole during Pride celebrations.

This is what’s happening in our health system, but we’ve yet to change our approach. Spending more of the U.S.’s GDP on health care than any other country has not returned longer life expectancies or lower incidences of disease. We can upend this dynamic by investing in the circumstances at the root of many of society’s chronic health issues – lack of opportunities for meaningful employment, access to vibrant neighborhoods, food security, stable housing, high-quality education.  A panel of experts evaluating interventions designed to improve these conditions will discuss how we can apply what they’re learning to change the paradigm about what we expect from our investments in health.

This same population championing gender equality seems to have forgotten people of color. This panel will be an interactive discussion about what it means to be an ally from a historically marginalized group. These senior leaders will unpack who continues to benefit from diversity programs, how white women are unconsciously failing people of color, and tactical ways they can show up as allies for other communities.

Making art is a radical act of sharing, and as such it can be a powerful driver of social awareness and empathic connection. Art can function as an invitation for both the artist and the viewer to go beyond their individual experiences and engage in the imaginative act of projecting themselves into a collective experience. In this way, art fosters a deeper understanding of the nature and range of shared human existence and all that it entails: joy, pain, love, grief, loss, wonder, longing, and so much more. This panel discussion brings together a cognitive expert and artists working in the public realm to explore the ways in which artistic practice can bring people closer together.Programming descriptions are generated by participants and do not necessarily reflect the opinions of SXSW.|30.2645713|-97.74319799999999

In an unpredictable profession due to uncontrollable environments, companies are investing their time and technologies to offer more precise and effective management solutions that can help farmers and ranchers enhance sustainability and withstand climate obstacles. But as agriculture embraces new technologies, there is significant pushback from the public who still embrace the romanticized way of farming – the big red barn, animals roaming around outside and a vintage tractor plowing across the field. The reality is, from nanotechnology used to improve crop inputs to smart cattle ear tags enhancing animal health, the modern farm is more efficient and more sustainable than ever before.

What would we need, as a society, to stop thinking of work and family as oppositional forces, eternally struggling against each other for time. There are certain policy proposals that would help a lot— increasing paid parental leave and sick leave programs, allowing more employees to work from home. There is small stuff, too. Breastfeeding spaces. More public spaces for work and play.  But most importantly, we need a shift in our society. We need to stop looking at the personal and professional as oppositional, and start looking at them as interwoven and inextricable. Moreover we have to start looking at a rich personal life as a resource, not a liability — both for our employers, our movement, and our country.

Whether you come from film, gaming, or the emerging XR industry, fundraising is a complex patchwork of debt instruments, tax breaks, grants, and private investment. Just look at Orson Welles, one of the greatest filmmakers of all time, who famously said “I've wasted the greater part of my life looking for money. It's about two percent movie making and 98 percent hustling.” But does fundraising need to be this difficult? Or can we invent a new model for financing projects that is more equitable, transparent, and artist-friendly?

The imperative? Match a free/ad-driven business with a subscription offering and, in many cases, a membership or events stream. The side effect has been that news publishers have had to dig deeper into how they allocate resources, develop coverage and deploy new technology such as artificial intelligence or advanced algorithms. A panel of industry leaders aggressively probing the possibilities will discuss the challenges, dissect the successes and lay out the kind of practical thinking news and media executives will need to push their organizations forward.Programming descriptions are generated by participants and do not necessarily reflect the opinions of SXSW.|30.2645713|-97.74319799999999

Indeed, a recent study from economists at NYU, Stanford, and the University of Chicago found that 55 percent of all U.S. ZIP codes with a median income below $25,000 are what's called ""food deserts"" -- neighborhoods where the only meal options are high-calorie, processed foods. But now some social entrepreneurs are finding ways to combat the food-desert dilemma through creative pricing strategies and educational programs that empower residents of these communities to make more wholesome food decisions.

Panelists will debate the society-wide dangers of fake and misleading media to democracy, privacy, cultural production, and more.

This episode of Shrink Speak will explore a major public health challenge that has gone under recognized, studied and addressed through social and health care initiatives.  Adversity and stress come in many forms throughout the life-cycle, however, it is especially pernicious in early life. Brain development during gestation, postnatally, infancy, early and late childhood is particularly susceptible to the potential of adversity to cause effects that are psychologically and emotionally traumatic and have enduring effects that impact the person’s behavior throughout life. Adversity comes in many forms; abuse, bullying, poverty, discrimination, drug abuse, poor education, lack of parenting, isolation etc. Whether these adverse experiences produce traumatic effects depends on their severity, longevity and the susceptibility and resilience of the individual. The consequences lead to mental illness, learning disabilities, anti-social behavior, violence, substance abuse and overall loss of functional capacity and potential productivity. Moreover, these effects can be intergenerational and transferred from parents to children iteratively.""

In just a few short years, these advances have transformed everything—from how people move in cities to how water purity can be monitored. However, doing the unprecedented also means facing new challenges, in particular disrupting traditional employment models and a social compact that generations of workers have come to rely on. Both in the United States and internationally, there is a call for a robust examination of how our basic social compact—the premise that if we work hard and do the right thing, we should all be able to get ahead—keeps pace with technological revolutions. From AI and automation, to more desegregated work, the future of work can only be examined effectively through cross-sector collaboration: labor unions, technologists, academics, and lawmakers alike must come together to design education and healthcare models, and explore opportunities for upward mobility fit for consumers, workers, and a 21st Century global economy.

One approach that seems to be growing in popularity is artist residency programs, which embed artists into technology and research enterprises and foster collaborations between the artists and engineers.

The majority of millennials see gender as a spectrum, rather than a binary, and 56% of Gen Z know someone who uses a gender-neutral pronoun. This research tells us that for companies, creating gender inclusive environments isn’t just about being inclusive - it’s a competitive advantage.  Companies must understand how to navigate this universe, but that's easier said than done. We live in a binary world, and the many of us who identify as trans, non-binary or gender-expansive are hyper aware of this. Drawing on research, anecdotes and concrete examples, the panelists will help explain what gender is (and isn’t) in the first place and address how companies can apply a gender-inclusive lens to every aspect of their business.

It suggests that we must instead restore each Place we encounter to a condition of wholeness. Seeing nature as (free) technology is a key step in restoring our buildings, neighborhoods, communities, and cities to their full potential. To leverage this technology a critical shift in philosophy is taking place. The built environment is no longer simply a “machine for living” as we have been taught by our modernist, international-style roots. Instead, a new notion of shared and intensely local habitat for people is coming into focus; one that is informed by the simple truth that WE ARE NATURE.

Today, we are “always on”, “always moving,” and our spaces move beyond “location” to accommodate a variety of work modes and continual collaboration.  Workers want to work how, when, and where they want -- without disruption in experience. So what are the standards in this new working environment, and what will they be in the future? How can companies use workplace data to exceed worker expectations and create environments where workers thrive and engage? We’ll explore these questions from the perspective of data and technology. How can existing technologies (like badges and WiFi hotspots) give you data to better understand how your space is being used today? How can IoT sensors be used to give fresh insights? And how should we contend with more advanced technologies like biometrics that provide rich data, yet erode personal privacy?

This begs the question, is there a better way? Our panel reveals how focusing on potential vs. competencies alone, can unlock an organization's capacity to hire and promote diverse talent. The ability to objectively and accurately assess what someone is truly capable of in the long term is critical to achieving a truly diverse and inclusive workplace. Focusing on potential, enables organizations to make the right investments in the right people, especially those who might have been denied opportunities due to unconscious and overt bias. In this session, we will show leaders how to ""hack diversity"" by assessing talent with a focus on potential.

What happens when we disrupt that pattern with large scale, immersive, spectacle creation in public environments?  Public art is no longer limited to permanent statues dedicated to the past, today contemporary technology, combined with archetypal splendor, can bring public spaces to life and ignite human connections.  In dialogue with two artist run collectives, Cocolab of Mexico and Macnas of Ireland, Kim Cook, Director of Art & Civic Engagement for Burning Man will explore the technology, old and new, that underlies awe-inspiring and dynamic experiences in public art activation worldwide.Programming descriptions are generated by participants and do not necessarily reflect the opinions of SXSW.|30.2645713|-97.74319799999999

At 18, Pedro Pimenta contracted bacterial meningitis, and to save his life, all four of his limbs were amputated. Every year, about 185,000 people in the U.S. lose a limb and find themselves facing the same question: what will my future look like?

With the demonization of sugar, its adverse effect on public health, and the upcoming changes of the nutrition facts panel, brands are forced to reevaluate their products to determine their congruency with consumer values. Necessity is the mother of invention, and the current matriarch is demanding alternatives to sugar. As consumers become more attuned to how much sugar they ingest daily, they are reevaluating choices they have made for decades – especially in beverages. This session will focus on sugar’s historical role in beverages, alternative sweeteners and novel sweetener technology, that may be the future of sweetness.

In a helicopter over Manhattan? The answer is South Sudan, shattered by war and one of the poorest nations on earth. Relative to income, the price of a simple plate of food there would be like an American paying $300. We’re not talking Michelin-star fancy stuff. Just some beans or lentils, a handful of rice or bread or corn, a dash of tomato sauce. We underestimate what it takes to secure affordable food: Peace. Mitigation of climate extremes. Functioning markets. This panel uses new optics to quantify disparities in access to food and examines ways to overcome them.

Today we are always connected and work longer hours. We are taking on more job responsibility with less job certainty. The workplace is the fifth leading cause of death in the US (120,000 people per year).  But there is hope. Companies are embracing well-being. These companies understand that healthier employees mean lower healthcare costs and more productive work forces. There’s also been this incredible juxtaposition between the amazing things that new tech is doing for us as consumers vs. the disruption and uncertainty it’s creating in the workplace. This session will reveal one-of-a-kind research on these misalignments of the workplace and wellness initiatives along with strategies to improve it.

While AI is already an integrated part of our lives, it often exists as intangible systems working behind screens. In Semeion, the AI manifests itself in several large minimalist structures, that individually and collectively respond to human presence. In its abstract form it evokes the human relation through its behavior. The viewer is invited to suspend their predispositions about AI, and engage with it in an explorative, curious way.

By creating a learning environment that uses immersive storytelling and interactive voice-based scenarios, VR can completely transform how front line staff in human services hone their skills and professional judgement.

However, our respective generational wisdom is almost in hermetically sealed containers with the wisdom trapped inside, like isolated countries that share a border but don’t necessarily trust each other. Breaking down these walls, there is just so much that we can all learn from each other. Based upon my experience as a Boomer in the land of the Millennials (Airbnb in Silicon Valley), I'm convinced that intergenerational wisdom exchange is the ultimate future workplace trade agreement.  This new collaboration may take the form of “mutual mentoring”: Millennial DQ (digital intelligence) for Boomer (and GenX) EQ (emotional intelligence). I experienced the benefits of this trade agreement as I evolved in my role at Airbnb while I was Head of Global Hospitality and Strategy and the in-house mentor for CEO and cofounder Brian Chesky. From my younger colleagues, I learned to love Google docs and create an Instagram account, but more importantly, I learned how to curate my life more adventurously as this generation is focused more on being “outwardly mobile” than “upwardly mobility,” more focused on experiencing the world than climbing the corporate ladder. They’ve helped me become a content and inspired “digital nomad” and break free of the chains of the three-stage life (learn, earn, retire).

As we age, our healthy biology rapidly deteriorates and becomes less effective. By rejuvenating our body with our own younger biology, we stand to elongate both healthspan and lifespan. The science behind longevity has seen exponential advancement, with hundreds of clinical trials showing success in stem cell rejuvenation for animals. This has sparked excitement for human applications, spanning from cosmetic restoration to the treatment of age-related diseases. On this panel, we’ll cover how technologies are allowing us to invest in the health of our future self and roll back the clock on aging cells.

The reason: a victim of its own success, the area now faces a death spiral of unsustainable real estate prices. With commercial real estate prices hovering at 2-3x the national average, it’s becoming increasingly challenging for startups to locate there. Given that real estate is the second biggest expense for businesses after payroll, it's no wonder that Peter Thiel complained recently that most of his investments wind up in the pockets of slumlords. We will explore how current urban models and investor preferences put most tech-friendly cities on a dangerous path to becoming luxury products for a new urban elite.

But what does being healthy actually mean? Is it calories? Low-fat? Gluten-free? A lifestyle? Inner peace? Join us as we bring together industry thought leaders from Bon Appetit's Healthyish, sweetgreen, and startup, Wonderfoods, to discuss why our obsession with health isn’t going away, what health means to their brands, and how they are writing the headline for America's next health trend.

In order to be successful, the team knew they would need to rely heavily upon feedback from the target audience – following the mantra of the disability community: “Nothing About Us Without Us.” Working with partners, such as Craig Hospital and Warfighter Engaged, the team initiated a comprehensive testing and feedback program for an adaptive controller. In doing so, they uncovered valuable insight, including identifying a secondary audience for the product, as well as learning that the controller would be used as a tool for therapists to help people with disabilities regain both social and physical strength.

Most of us live with the unconscious reality that our perception creates our personal realities, and with this subconscious belief comes conscious work to be done. Even more, we tend to think that our personalities change, when in fact, they don't. What's changing is everything around us. That's why who you are really depends on who you're with—the people around you give context to the way you're experienced. This is one of the reasons why it’s so hard to replicate success from one team to the next or from leading one company to another: it’s not about you. It’s about you in the context of them.

AI is currently a $15 billion industry, on track to become a $70 billion industry by 2020. AI-powered tech is increasingly being incorporated into the products/services we use for example with chatbots and call centers. As we continue to foray deeper into this new frontier, designers need to better understand how to best leverage the technology, to not only give them an edge but also to prime themselves for the future allowing them to do their best work. Tania Philip, VP of Product at Shutterstock will address some of the ways AI has disrupted product design and how design might bridge the gap between learning algorithms and customer expectations.Programming descriptions are generated by participants and do not necessarily reflect the opinions of SXSW.|30.2645713|-97.74319799999999

Young people are exercising their First Amendment free-speech rights to speak out on cutting-edge issues like school shootings and President Trump’s policies on immigration. Student journalists have joined the fray – often filling an information gap in news deserts where local coverage is lost or minimal.

Institutions have tended to project authority rather than empathy and emotional connection. However, museums' aspiration to grow attendance beyond traditional art audiences has begun to create opportunities for playful engagement almost unthinkable a decade ago. Digital experiences, particularly AR, have played a key role in this development. Focusing on delight, more than didactic forms of education, can have powerful effects on fostering understanding and engagement among visitors of all ages. This panel will examine trends in the field and take a deep dive on findings from the immersive Interpretive Gallery created by SFMOMA and frog in 2018 for the “Magritte: The Fifth Season” exhibition.

And yet, the tech industry still struggles to make progress increasing diversity and promoting inclusion, especially for members of underrepresented groups. This honest, transparent session will focus on apprenticeship and other preparation programs that aim to correct for social inequities in access to education, information, and resources -- all necessary ingredients to help candidates from underrepresented backgrounds enter the tech industry.    Programs offered through Treehouse, including apprenticeships, create opportunities for people who have largely been excluded from the industry. Instead of continuing the ‘pipeline problem’ narrative, apprenticeship holds particular promise for companies who wish to close gaps in representation and access to opportunity. Using apprenticeships and prep programs, companies can create entirely new pipelines and develop talent for the future workplace. Join Tyi McCray, PhD, Diversity Strategy Lead at Airbnb, and Ryan Carson, CEO & Founder of Treehouse, as they share their experiences on the realities of building new pathways of entry into industry.Programming descriptions are generated by participants and do not necessarily reflect the opinions of SXSW.|30.2645713|-97.74319799999999

These innovators believe there is much more to VR than gaming, and crossing the uncanny valley is the key to getting there. First observed in 1970, the Uncanny Valley marks the point when something is real, but not real enough, making users disturbed and even revolted. Can we cross the valley? Have a few experiences already made the leap? How did they do it? Panelists discuss these questions and their implications, including the implications for standalone headsets, indie studios and society at large.

How do we make happiness more than a cup of coffee with a friend or shared smile with a stranger? How do we make it actually stick into our daily routines as we seek to build both interpersonal and global connectedness? As it turns out, choosing to be happy is just half the battle. Pulling ourselves and others up from the spiral of loneliness is just a good start.  Put down your cells phones and come listen for an hour, you might just hear something that will stick.

Recent years have introduced meat and dairy alternatives, like lab-grown meat, insect protein, and nut milks, but eventually those will become inaccessible as resources become scarce. You can't farm mealworms without grains to feed them, and you can't get almond milk if the trees can't grow. In the dystopia, food will have to be RECYCLED. Scraps and sewage will become sustenance. If it sounds gross, that's because it is -- but it doesn't have to be. With the right engineering, wastewater becomes beer, discarded grains become wheat, and human waste becomes nutritional goo. The future may not look promising, but these scientists and food innovators firmly believe we won't starve.Programming descriptions are generated by participants and do not necessarily reflect the opinions of SXSW.|30.2645713|-97.74319799999999

While AI is already an integrated part of our lives, it often exists as intangible systems working behind screens. In Semeion, the AI manifests itself in several large minimalist structures, that individually and collectively respond to human presence. In its abstract form it evokes the human relation through its behavior. The viewer is invited to suspend their predispositions about AI, and engage with it in an explorative, curious way.

In this panel, we bring together several experts who are building VR communities inside and outside of the headsets. They have figured out ways to combine the real world with the virtual world, recruiting some unlikely allies.

They have the potential to reshape the healthcare industry.

But, the way people use them hasn't fundamentally changed... until now. Today, self driving cars are more than a moonshot, they're a reality. And turning this technology into a service that people can use in their daily lives requires a whole new set of considerations. Consider the design challenges at hand when you have a virtual driver, and a vacant driver's seat: How do riders indicate they're ready for their trip to start? How should the car communicate what it's seeing, doing and what route it plans to take to inform and assure riders experiencing the technology for the first time? And down the line, how might we design cars differently when you don’t have to consider a human driver?

We want to share some thoughts on some challenges we’ve faced when designing solutions for people that have been usually left out or misunderstood, whom we’ve called the “forgotten”: from a single working mom in Peru or a community leader in Nepal to a blind senior citizen in Spain, they all have very inspiring stories that enrich our perspectives and help us create better, more inclusive, more human.

Meanwhile, some food companies are also making sweeping sustainability commitments, leading to a fracture in the industry—including mass defections from the Grocery Manufacturers Association, the industry’s biggest lobbying group. In a sector where just a few companies dominate how food is produced, delivered, marketed, and consumed, those commitments could have huge impact on the environment and the supply chain. But there is already a track record of letting such commitments slide. Three industry experts will debate the future of Big Food’s commitment to sustainability, and the prospects for significant and enduring change in how our food is produced and sold.

For one person it’s inspirational and aspirational, for many others the very thought of money inspires fear and dread. For design to be truly human we need to think #finsense, not #fintech, and accept and address the varied and polarising emotions around money.

While AI is already an integrated part of our lives, it often exists as intangible systems working behind screens. In Semeion, the AI manifests itself in several large minimalist structures, that individually and collectively respond to human presence. In its abstract form it evokes the human relation through its behavior. The viewer is invited to suspend their predispositions about AI, and engage with it in an explorative, curious way.

Programming in this track is designed to inform attendees about this fast-changing industry, and does not promote the use or sale of illegal drugs. “What Are You Smoking?” host and cannabis columnist Will Hyde will be joined by representatives of the cannabis industry in Massachusetts, California, and Canada to discuss how the patchwork system of state laws is shaping the cannabis industry -- and not for the better. As cannabis gets legalized on a state-by-state basis, legislative quirks are impacting the kinds of products available to consumers and patients, and making it hard for successful companies to grow, hamstringing competition. Meanwhile, Canada is demonstrating that even federal legalization of cannabis doesn’t always mean predictable standards from province to province. We’ll look at what legislators can do to make things more seamless for the industry and how companies are working around current obstacles.

He is a multi-instrumentalist who plays a little bit of everything in the recording studio and who surrounds himself with other musicians on stage. Les Louanges launched his first EP, Le Mercure, on his Bandcamp page in 2016. He added an extra track, Encéphaline (which won a SOCAN Songwriting Prize), then formally released the EP the following year. Finalist at the 2017 Francouvertes, the Montreal-based Lévis-native, embarks on a new path by exploring more chillwave, R&B and hip-hop sounds on his debut full-length 'La nuit est une panthère' which was released in September 2018. Les Louanges presented his 14 pieces at the Transmusicales of Rennes in France, where he was selected to perform in December 2018. His new album is a good mix of eclectic songs. It’s pop; it’s jazzy (the song Jupiter), with a perfectly balanced amount of R&B (Westcott), hip-hop (Tercel) and chillwave. Great contemporary composers as well as a new generation of forward thinking artists inspire his music.

On  the  third  and  fourth  volumes  of  From  The  Series  of  Songs  “Altogether  Unaccompanied”,  the  Montréal-based  artist  has  amassed  a  collection  of  memories  in  song  form,  more  like  a  box  of  old  photos  or  unsent  letters  than  a  traditional  EP.   “The  songs  are  to  be  considered  as  their  own  little  things,”  she  says  about  her  unconventional  release  structure.  “They  are  part  of  something  larger,  yes,  but  they  live  on  their  own.”  As  a  listener,  however,  there  is  an  undeniable  cohesion  to  Vol.  III  and  IV,  and  to  the  previous  iterations  of  the  project:  each  song  is  nostalgic,  intimate,  and  indelible.   “I’m  learning  to  be  really  patient,”  she  says,  “I  can’t  really  force  writing.  When  I’m  ready  to  write  a  song  the  words  and  melody  are  usually  there.”  Programming descriptions are generated by participants and do not necessarily reflect the opinions of SXSW.|30.2605012|-97.7383708
1351|Mar 11, 2019|92 Rainey St. Austin, TX, EUA|Ouri|10:40pm|10:00pm|Bungalow|Ouri is a DJ, electronic producer and multi-instrumentalist. Hailing from South America by way of France, she produces electronic music in Montreal. Her background experience with the piano, harp and cello heavily influence her shape-shifting approach to melody and bass. Her 2015 EP Maze is a provocative experience of vivid, entrancing dance music. Aggressive, refreshing and playful, her sound is bold and self-assured. In 2017, Ouri released her debut album Superficial, a kind of laboratory where she mixes her truth with chaos. Her obsession with strong sensations, femininity and this same truth makes up the heart of this project. In late 2017, she joined force with Montreal-based singer-songwriter Mind Bath and dropped a surprise self-titled EP. The Ouri / Mind Bath EP features both tenderness and aggressiveness, and balances the femininity and masculinity of the two artists. Over the years, Ouri has easily proven that she is an artistic force. She was tapped to participate in Red Bull Music Academy’s 2017 Montreal Bass Camp where she shared studio time from some of contemporary electronic musics brightest stars.

1352|Mar 11, 2019|92 Rainey St. Austin, TX, EUA|Moonshine|1:50am|11:00pm|Bungalow|Depending on whom you ask, the esoteric effects of lunar cycles can be wide-ranging: good fortune, human fertility, ocean tides, werewolf prevalence and loss of sanity among them. For the like-minded musicians, DJs, dancers and visual artists who make up the Moonshine collective, the planetary satellite above all inspires their eponymous monthly event, driven by an inclusive ethos and a shared love for experimentations in dance culture. Since its founding in 2014, Moonshine has carved out an enviable niche in Montréal’s nightlife milieu by celebrating a wide range of fledgling local talents, championing Afro-futuristic, bass-heavy, electro-funk sounds, and bringing together communities that wouldn’t necessarily cross paths otherwise. As the name indicates, the lunar-based Moonshine recipe has the collective throw an all-night, sensory-soaked party on the Saturday after every full moon in ever-shifting, unpredictable locations across the city, always strictly disclosed via text messages. With fresh cuts supplied by resident DJs Pierre Kwenders and Bonbon Kojak, visual installations by Boycott, and a slew of live musicians and performers.

1355||92 Rainey St. Austin, TX, EUA|The Dirty Nil|||Bungalow|Sure, playing 350 shows over the past three years all over the world was pretty impressive, but The Dirty Nil didn’t just spend the past few years on the road in support of their debut album, Higher Power. They spent much of it opening for—and, more importantly, studying—the greats: Against Me!, Billy Talent, Alexisonfire. They’re bands who, like the Nil, cut their teeth for years on the local circuit, but now find themselves playing arenas and headlining festivals. With Master Volume, The Dirty Nil are ready to make the same leap—not by polishing their sound for radio, but by bulking it up to fill the stadiums and open fields of their most vivid rock ‘n’ roll fantasies.  Produced by John Goodmanson, Master Volume is an album that crunches and grooves where the band once smashed and trashed, unleashing the Nil’s undiminished raw power in more controlled waves to better target the back rows. “It’s less of a sprint and more of a strut,” singer Luke Bentham says. Loaded with steady-grooving songs about living fast and life-affirming anthems about dying young, Master Volume ultimately amplifies The Dirty Nil’s most essential quality: their refusal to be defined.

Or, as the band describes it: “Dead Soft is grunge-punk for the people.” Their most recent EP, New Emotion, features five catchy, earnest fuzzed-out rock songs that act as an empowering reminder that you are in control of your life, even when life feels out of control. After a string of singles, Dead Soft released their self-titled debut in 2014 on Kingfisher Bluez and JEFF the Brotherhood’s Infinity Cat Recordings. The band spent the next four years on the road, including support tours with Bully and The Dirty Nil.  Their new EP, released by Canadian indie label Arts & Crafts, is focused on the themes of loss/renewal and new beginnings which aligns closely with changes in the band. Specifically, the recent additions of Alex Smith (drums) and Kyle Schick (guitar) have allowed for a bigger sound, more hooky guitar leads, and more Beach Boys-like harmonies.Programming descriptions are generated by participants and do not necessarily reflect the opinions of SXSW.|30.2605012|-97.7383708
1359||92 Rainey St. Austin, TX, EUA|La Force|||Bungalow|La Force is Ariel Engle, vocalist and newest member of Broken Social Scene. The music of La Force is nocturnal electronic pop, featuring Engle's enchanting vocals over dynamic production. Her presence resounds on Broken Social Scene’s 2017 album, Hug Of Thunder, lending fluid, commanding vocals to the oblique anthem “Stay Happy,” and leaving an indelible mark on the collective’s rousing performances. Stepping up to the role first helmed by the immeasurable talent of Leslie Feist, Engle brings La Force's singularity to the familial energy of Broken Social Scene. Born out of the culmination of AroarA – her musical project with husband and Broken Social Scene bandmate Andrew Whiteman – La Force is a deep reflection on the magic and dismantlement of motherhood; the never-ending tightrope walk of life, and death; and the re-discovery of self.

Although the majority of the playing heard on ‘Amir’ is Tamino himself, he is joined by a collective of Arabic musicians based in Brussels called ‘Nagham Zikrayat’. The Firka (Ochestra) is predominantly made up of professional musicians from the Middle East, most of which have refugee status having predominantly fled from Iraq and Syria.  Over the course of ‘Amir’, Tamino captures a range of emotions from romance to desolation, and almost everything in between. It’s mood music, painted in a number of different shades.

A name that reflects a lack of artifice in the music and the vision of the people behind it: Phoebe Lou and Joey Clough, kindred musical spirits who have been doing this since they were 15. With support already from from the likes of Gorilla vs Bear, XLR8R and Stereogum, their appearances at SxSW will be their first in the US. Like all good projects, this one started with a manifesto. “Let’s aim small and let it be big,” the pair wrote in a lengthy document guiding the recording process of debut album First Body, out via Liberation Records (Vance Joy, Julia Jacklin) and Terrible Records (Solange, Blood Orange) January 2019. Phoebe and Joey weren’t exactly sure what kind of music would come out of those early sessions in 2015, but they were clear on how they wanted to do things. Their art would be sustainable, long-term, and almost entirely self-made. It’d be guided by bold visual cues, DIY principles, and artists that emphasise the empty space between notes as much as the notes themselves; artists such as James Blake, Caribou, and Jamie xx. “The music, above all else has to move you, physically and emotionally,” they wrote. And it does. Programming descriptions are generated by participants and do not necessarily reflect the opinions of SXSW.|30.2605012|-97.7383708

In this fun and interactive aikido workshop, “Aiki Lab,” you will explore exercises that reveal your natural defenses, as well as offer embodiment skills for confidence-building, improved communication, and transcendence of fear.  Experience how utilizing ""beneficent intention"" can help overcome natural fear responses and create a peaceful outcome even in the face of unexpected fear/violence.

Utilizing 30+ years of study and Aikido principals as taught by Morihei Ueshiba, Sensei Quakenbush discusses how peaceful communication practices and conflict resolution technologies like Aiki-Lab are imperative (both in daily life and globally) for human societies to survive, thrive, and evolve.

Walk-ups may be accepted on a first come, first served basis. Developing desktop and mobile versions of an app either requires multiple codebases or reliance on cross-platform frameworks that can make it cumbersome or impossible to reach native code performance or capabilities. We’ll look at how the JUCE framework makes it easy to develop high-performance apps that run natively on Windows, macOS/iOS, Android, and Linux with a single codebase and no compromise on speed or capabilities. JUCE is especially well-suited for domains requiring high performance including video and live processing of audio. Modern design techniques like vector-based UI, FlexBox and CSS Grid simplify the development of responsive interfaces that remain usable at any scale or layout configuration. In  this session we’ll develop a JUCE app that shows all these capabilities.

Walk-ups may be accepted on a first come, first served basis. Our senses are the foundations upon which we build our perception of the world. Channeling them in specific ways can lead to powerful experiences or revelations.  Adding motion to anything static communicates dynamism. Applying texture to any surface gives tactility. Coupling sound and experience conveys emotion. Infusing smell with taste can illicit memory. Privileging one or two out of these five requires mediation. Giving equal opportunity to all of these creates immersion.  Technology has yet to fully engage all the human senses. Using the medium of drawing, this session will conduct a live experiment about how low-tech approaches to conveying sensorial immersion can help to transform the perception of belief.

Walk-ups may be accepted on a first come, first served basis. Let's investigate a difficult issue that can be emotional, personal and also societal: what does it mean to have children in the midst of a potentially catastrophic climate crisis? While the majority of people do not yet consider climate change in family planning, a growing chorus of voices says that we ought to. It is now well documented that having fewer or no children is the most effective way to reduce one's carbon emissions. Some people decide against it because they feel it is unethical to exacerbate our environmental challenges in an age of overpopulation, while others fear a rapidly changing world might harm their child’s ability to have a healthy, successful life. And some people counter by saying that humanity has always risen to solve great challenges. Many different cultural, class and religious divides shape our views on this complex topic. Come explore the tensions and debates around these issues, and begin to channel our individual views and feelings into positive, collective work in the world.

Walk-ups may be accepted on a first come, first served basis. It’s no secret that the 2016 Election highlighted great divides in the U.S., whether between family, neighbors, or perfect strangers. In an attempt to build understanding and move forward, two Bay Area friends Justine & Tria decided to go back to the basics of human interaction: they invited neighbors of different political viewpoints to sit down to dinner. The aim was not to debate or change minds, but to listen. Thirty dinners and a dozen cities later, the two are eager to share their learnings. In this hands-on workshop, you’ll be guided on how to design an environment and activities around dinner that help folks navigate disagreements, humanize one another, and hopefully, find common ground.

Walk-ups may be accepted on a first come, first served basis. Great actions are a conversation. Conversational, natural language, interfaces are emerging as a powerful new way for people to interact with digital services. In order to design a natural user interface, we need to apply a human-centered design approach. Research by Stanford professor Clifford Nass shows that people converse with computers in much the same way as they do with humans. They are most successful when the interface is natural and conversational.  There’s a process for creating conversations. The Conversation Design Sprint teaches that process. This hands-on design sprint shows how to design and prototype a conversational experience using new Google Design Sprint methodologies. It presents the theory and principles of social interaction, crafting the personality and dialog of the conversational agent, the rapid prototyping of the conversation, and exploring how the conversation changes when it’s manifested on multimodal surfaces such as mobile and wearables.

Walk-ups may be accepted on a first come, first served basis. Let's face it, architecting mobile software to be both flexible and maintainable is no easy endeavor. It’s especially challenging to avoid over-coupling of business and presentation logic in modern apps which have inputs coming in from multiple sources, where any one state change may affect several screens at once. In our workshop we are going to introduce you to Redux — an architecture paradigm which reduces business and presentation coupling by favoring a unidirectional flow of data through the app. We’ll share the tips we’ve picked up while using this architecture to deliver a #1 app in the App Store, and through the workshop, you’ll learn how this pattern prevents entire categories of bugs from being possible, promotes testability, and results in code that is easy to understand and maintain as your app changes over time.

Walk-ups may be accepted on a first come, first served basis. Advocating and evangelizing for design can be challenging. How do we embrace pushback and know how to respond? How do we remain positive, conversational, and use artifacts to make a clear case for our process and our users? This workshop makes the design community stronger by allowing all attendees to share our tactics and techniques. As designers, regardless of being in-house, agency, or otherwise, we must know how to negotiate and navigate difficult scenarios with partners of all types. We create the best possible outcome for our users—but that's not always the no-brainer we hope for. This exercise is going to put attendees on their feet. They will play a role—either an antagonist or a protagonist. With given pushback topic/prompts in hand, designers will plan an improvised scene.

Walk-ups may be accepted on a first come, first served basis. As technology becomes more pervasive in our style choices, how can we think beyond simple customization or apps to truly own outward identity? In this workshop we will examine how artists and innovators are thinking beyond consumer wearables to larger identity issues that can be addressed by our choice of apparel and accessories. We will explore the ways the design community is expanding, hacking, and creating through open source technology. When the fashion and technology industries begin to collaborate, what opportunities do these open platforms create for the future of self expression? Participants will explore some of these ideas through customizing a wearable electronic project to augment their interactions with the world.Programming descriptions are generated by participants and do not necessarily reflect the opinions of SXSW.|30.2666201|-97.7403752

Walk-ups may be accepted on a first come, first served basis. In today’s world of unprecedented stress, more women than ever are experiencing hormone imbalances that result in painful and irregular periods. Our society has normalized painful periods, when in fact they are not normal. As women it is our birthright to have pain-free periods. Our periods serve as a monthly report card evaluating our overall health. Today, the common solution to “cure” painful and irregular periods is with hormonal birth control which will only silence the symptoms instead of curing the root cause. When females learn how to harmonize with the natural rhythm of their cycles,they will experience a new type of body literacy which empowers them to operate at a higher vibration.This session explains how painful periods,PMS, and mood swings can and will be a thing of the past.

Walk-ups may be accepted on a first come, first served basis. Who creates social change? Women. And now, more than ever, we need each other. To succeed at safeguarding ourselves and our communities in the cultural environment we’re in, we must break out of our homogenous circles and stand in solidarity with women who look different than us. But the truth is, we have some history that is not great.  We need to heal our divides, which requires facing them and taking accountability.  ALL women are created equal. ALL women have an important role to play. Yet 9 times out of 10, women's empowerment events are either largely focused on and attended by white women, or by women of color.

In this workshop, learn to forecast effects for products and design for positive impact. As designers, we’re in a powerful position to lead the ethical tech movement because our craft is grounded in human-centered insights.

Walk-ups may be accepted on a first come, first served basis. Using story to communicate your brand can sometimes resemble guess work more than an intentional craft. When it comes to brand building, we’ll often overcompensate with trendy graphics and fancy drone shots to hope that maybe our audience will forget that the substance is lacking. Understanding the science behind brand-building storytelling can change that. In this workshop, we'll dive deeper into the psychology of story and how to use it to drive action from your audience. We'll then put the theory to practice by breaking out into smaller groups and teaching story structure.  This process has been taught to diplomats at the United Nations, crowds at Tedx and teams at Apple to empower more intentional brand decisions that drive results.

Walk-ups may be accepted on a first come, first served basis. Whether we're designing in-house, at an agency, or consulting, dynamics across interdisciplinary teams are more complex than ever. Without intentional focus and maintenance, a healthy relationship between collaborators gives way to miscommunication and roadblocks. So, when was the last time you checked the pulse of your team's culture? Every team forms a culture, whether it's healthy, disengaged, or straight up toxic. When designing in a bubble isn't an option, we need to cultivate a vulnerable work environment to build trust and align around common goals. In this workshop, you'll gain tools to empower your team to take ownership of its culture. Come learn to assess cultural health, identify ingrained patterns, and strategize better ways to work together. Leave this workshop ready to lead your design team to interdisciplinary harmony, with the outcomes to prove it.

Shy Beast has introduced itself and offered its complex and appealing music over the past year, but now, in “My Stride,” it demonstrates its power. It is clear how the group appeals to many with its various themes and open atmospheres of possibility.  Shy Beast hails from Austin but plays to the entire world. The music showcases Mariclaire Glaeser’s immense vocal range and tones of diamond clarity.  Her voice is feminine but also liberated and absolutely commanding of the songs.  The guitars of David Tenczar and Andrew Bennett are undeterred in growing the forest of melodies in which Glaeser sings. Drew Silverman’s unmistakable drumming guides us through the musical abundance and back again, all hits, no misses.  Farther down in the sonic underworld, Jay Cesak’s bass rhythms don’t wait for verses, choruses or instrumental breaks.  They continue to call until we become the monster and dance with the beast. Newcomers to Shy Beast’s music may be assured that yes, the band plays electro-pop, but the boundaries of that are sure to be re-drawn with this new creature entering the musical fray.

While health has improved over the last century, healthcare has hit a wall. Rapidly rising costs have not been matched with commensurate improvements in health outcomes. In fact, life expectancy has actually declined in the US in the last 3 years. Dr. David Feinberg, who is heading up Google's health efforts, and Dr. Clay Johnston, founding dean of the highly innovative Dell Medical School at UT Austin, will discuss opportunities for the next several decades, when healthcare will finally embrace technology and catch up with society’s interests in health.

Austin, TX, EUA|Hacker Heroes and Villains: Evolving Role in Media|6:00pm|5:00pm|Fairmont Manchester AB|Hackers may fascinate and terrify us, but they might be the immune system of our digital society. While dependence on connected technology has grown faster than our ability to secure it, friendly hackers improve public safety, public policy, and save lives - through security research. Yet media portrayals of hackers lack authenticity and fidelity, focused on harmful behavior and motivations, instead of diverse narratives in the real hacker community. Hacking is a superpower: for good or for ill. Better media role models will create the hacker heroes we need. Real world hackers team with fictional counterparts to examine hacker roles in society vs media. The audience will understand who hackers really are, who they can be, and what drives them - and will distinguish myth from reality.Programming descriptions are generated by participants and do not necessarily reflect the opinions of SXSW.|30.26204559999999|-97.7381328

This is arguably the only event in recorded human history when the world, stopped, waited in anticipation and then joined together to celebrate a positive human achievement. The space race drove America to shoot for the moon, but the spirit of Apollo also spurred on technological leaps that created the game changers of today and into the future.

Austin, TX, EUA|How AI is Changing Advertising in China|12:00pm|11:00am|Fairmont Congressional A|Advertising in China is at the frontlines in AI adoption and innovation. The majority of ad spend in China is already digital, and AI-based advertising thrives on the massive datasets available in China for number crunching and automation. The key driver for AI in advertising, however, is China’s hyper-competitive ecommerce market, which is more than double the size of its US counterpart. China-based startups use AI to analyze, categorize, and rank influencers, creating an open, blockchain-based, micropayments marketplace that can include everyone on social media. China’s white hot AI advertising applications can serve as roadmaps and spark ideas in other industries that are just beginning to move through the AI learning curve.

We’ll discuss how to encourage young people to become politically aware and active. In a world where exclusion, confrontation, and powerlessness feel ubiquitous, political participation is more important than ever. Especially young people face an increasingly uncertain future – shaped by others who won’t be nearly as affected by it. But studies show that awareness for the importance of democracy is declining in younger generations. At the same time, numerous student-led initiatives create high visibility and momentum for their concerns. How do these aspects relate to each other? What motivates young people to engage in politics – and how can we support and amplify their participation?

But before we allow AI to solve our problems, we need to solve its' biggest problem first: bias. As AI continues to spread, countless examples of bias have risen: from racist facial recognition to the proliferation of sexist language, AI is far from perfect. Before we let the cold, mathematical calculations of AI tackle our difficult questions, we need to rethink its algorithms, how they are written, and even who writes them. Our expert panel from across the nonprofit, industry, and education sectors will discuss ways we can tackle algorithmic bias.Programming descriptions are generated by participants and do not necessarily reflect the opinions of SXSW."|30.26204559999999|-97.7381328

Is it the creative director? Brand manager? The viewer? Who makes the call that the Asian neighbor cast in a beer ad isn’t “the token?” Who decides if a script is bringing to life a harmless trope or a harmful stereotype? Are diverse industry leaders the antidote to culturally insensitive or appropriating work? Is that responsibility even fair?

Austin, TX, EUA|Final Industrial Revolution: Life After Labor End|4:30pm|3:30pm|Fairmont Manchester EFG|Beyond the “Fourth Industrial Revolution,” Peng T Ong addresses the “Final Industrial Revolution,” a sea change with major leadership challenges and risk management issues. Driven by the impact of AI and machine learning, this revolution will redefine the world’s economies and labor forces, reducing the labor value towards zero creating “economic singularity”. Labor is the mechanism we use to redistribute wealth. If its value tends towards zero then how do we redistribute value and what do we do post-labor? And how do we get from here to there? The reason we need to worry about this is that it is (for now) a low probability event, with a very high impact outcome. Given the exponential pace of tech evolution, we need to plan around this issue as a risk management strategy.

Or will our learnings from the last few decades of dedicated visual storytelling inform how we innovate this next wave of audio-led communication and experience?

Some of these elements we already know:  storytelling is now more social, more mobile and more visual. But a new frontier of storytelling is also emerging. Enter ""hyper-growth"" startup brands that use that special combination --audience data, and unique narratives-- to beat out well-established, better funded competitors. As Megan Cunningham found in her research, ""The power of a well-told story distributed in a strategic way can change minds and overturn industries; and the playbook is being written today."" Carbon is disrupting manufacturing in the way that Tesla disrupted the auto industry.  Meet Dara Treseder, Carbon's first CMO. She's a marketing leader whose time at GE, Apple, and Goldman prepared her for the challenge of a lifetime: putting a B2B tech brand on the map in a mainstream way, virtually overnight. Join Cunningham of Magnet Media (and author of The State of the Story and The Art of the Documentary) for an exploration of how their approach cut through the most cluttered media moment to put Riddell helmet and Adidas sneaker products, powered by Carbon, at the center of the conversation.

Austin, TX, EUA|Bridging Diversity in the Film Industry Meet Up|12:00pm|11:00am|Fairmont Verbena|The Film and Television Industries have always been a dominant form of cultural and socio-economical influence in our society. Consistently, people from all walks of life are inspired by the stories and characters we watch. Ideological messages from our favorite shows influence our lives and even form parts of our identity. Since the invention of the film camera, there has been a pervasive heteronormative and patriarchal dominance within this medium. For those of us that are represented by a diverse minority culture, how can we remove these prevailing ideologies in the media and tell our own stories from our own perspective? And in the industry itself, how do we infiltrate the creative process?

Austin, TX, EUA|Who Will Lead in the Race for AI in Defense?|1:30pm|12:30pm|Fairmont Manchester AB|“Who rules AI will rule the world.” So said Vladimir Putin in a 2017 speech to Russian students. He’s not the only one who believes this; nations around the world, from China to the U.A.E. to the U.S., are racing to be the leader in artificial intelligence research and technology, for both civilian and military applications. This approach hardly seems unfounded, either--the edge AI provides in both war and peace has the potential to decide the shape of the international stage in the coming future.  Where does this AI “space race” currently stand? How will it change the future of warfare? And how will it change the future of the globe? This session will discuss who will lead in the race for artificial intelligence in Defense and National Security, and why is it of utmost importance.

We’ll debate hot button issues like when to use AI and ML—and whether or not it really works.

The core of the earth is 6000C, and drilling only 5-10 miles down would give us access to temperatures that far exceed what we need to create unlimited, CO2 free, clean energy. So why haven't we done this? Because a set of technical and engineering problems related to high temperature, deep drilling technologies are currently holding us back. These problems are solvable, and addressing them will enable our energy ""silver bullet."" A consortium has formed at the University of Texas at Austin, combining legacy drilling engineering expertise with our robust entrepreneurial ecosystem.

From PepsiGate to Blood Normal and #isitokforguys. Love it or hate it, the idea of brand purpose and ‘purpose campaigns’ is here to stay. But while it’s become little more than a buzzword we use for clients, no one really talks about purpose when it comes to agencies themselves.  ‘Making great work’ may have justified starting a shop in the past, but in the era of the in-house creative and the professional freelancer, how do you persuade the talent of the future to join you? Or clients to buy you? And maybe even... do something worthwhile with your job? This session argues that the agency of the future needs a clearly defined purpose in order to thrive, and then shows you how to do it with case studies and cautionary tales alike.

Big business and internet culture are colliding like never before: Wendy’s dropped a diss track on Twitter, IKEA made an ASMR ad, and Arby’s + Warby Parker aligned for April Fool’s Day. We call this “Wacko World,” and think it’s one of the biggest creative opportunities today. Attention has become an elusive metric as marketers compete with Drake memes for views once guaranteed with a TV ad.

Users are questioning the extent to which privacy is granted online and how businesses handle their personal data. In response, social networks have renewed their commitments to user and data privacy through both policy and platform change. As a result, marketers have had to reassess how they spend their money, where they spend it, and the content they produce.

The notion that disabled people are recipients rather than drivers of design has embedded itself into our language. And yet, disabled people are the Original Lifehackers. We spend our lives cultivating an intuitive creativity, because we navigate a world that is not built for our bodies.

Algorithms make important decisions that affect our lives, from how we are policed to what ads we see online, and yet the datasets on which they’re built are inconsistent, unrepresentative, and not always appropriately vetted or used. In other words, the problem with bad outcomes isn’t always the machine or the algorithm - it is often the health of the data itself. In an effort to address this problem, there are several initiatives and methods currently being tested to address dataset health. This panel will bring together experts across industry, academia, and government to discuss methods for identifying bad data, and ways to appropriately address problematic inputs.

Come join Young Survival Coalition, the only organization dedicated to young adults diagnosed with breast cancer. Together, we will network, share our experiences and learn from each other.  Young adult survivors are in a unique position since most of their peers have not received a serious health diagnosis, yet they cannot fully relate to other adult patients who are decades older either. Emotional trauma like isolation amongst friends and confronting a sudden loss of youth and immortality is not uncommon for young adults faced with cancer.  Share your personal journey, explore these questions and educate each other. You do not have to be a young adult diagnosed with cancer to attend. Anyone interested in this topic is welcome.

For folks with visual or muscular impairments, voice can enable them to do a variety of tasks and gain back some independence.

Our corporations and the culture they create glorify individualism at the expense of cooperation, threatening the sustainability not just of our economy but our species. In his new manifesto, Douglas Rushkoff reveals this agenda at work and invites us to remake society toward human ends rather than the end of humans. There’s still time to think before we hit the switch and automate ourselves out of existence. We must reconnect with our essentially social nature, assert a place for humans in the emerging landscape, and forge solidarity with the others who understand that being human is team sport.

Austin, TX, EUA|Featured Session: Localizing Food to Restore Human Health |4:30pm|3:30pm|Fairmont Manchester CD|Localizing Food to Restore Human Health  As culturally-unique flavors and locally-grown seasonal ingredients disappear while morbidity and obesity rates rise, we face a need for innovation in food like never before; the “scientific” advancements of agriculture in the last hundred years have at best increased yield but at the cost of massive environmental and public health damage; much of what it produces barely qualifies as food. Yet food exists at the intersection of want and need like nothing else in human nature, and is in a way at the heart of culture, an element that brings us together to connect and exchange ideas. Here, we will discuss the democratization of access to the pure, clean food and flavors of our ancestors, bringing culture back to our tables, habits back to our cooking, and health back to humanity, through a combination of increasingly popular methods that are both old and new.

Implementing it though can be a slow process that takes a toll on existing staff and new hires alike. But what happens when diversity comes from the top down? When leadership represents many points of view? When the Dailey team bought itself back from its holding company of 30+ years, they knew the new managing partners would be a more diverse group than most. What they didn’t grasp is how quickly their leadership could affect the deeply-rooted culture of an agency founded half a century before. From the nuts-and-bolts of pay equity audits to socially conscious creative projects, join Dailey’s leadership for a discussion about how diverse leadership can create a space in which all kinds of people thrive.

Without a new model of success, we’ll have (more) blood on our hands. We measure volume instead of value and trick our audiences into engaging with meaningless messages. We inflame audiences to counter content apathy. Because hate-likes are better than no likes. We monetise hatred and give a voice to dehumanising opinion masquerading as fact. As our audiences wise up, we use new tech to make truth indistinguishable from lies. This is our fault and we must take responsibility. While most (probably) don’t write for InfoWars, we do perpetuate the system. A better content industry is built on less content and new metrics of measurement. It’s built on fact checking and a new model of responsibility for distribution.

Your repulsion to the words above may be trivial, but the effects of language – particularly language that finds its way into our daily routine – can be significant and far-reaching. (“Fake news” anyone?) This talk will seek to shed light on how language is weaponized against us, while probing the question of why these linguistic assaults are so effective in the first place. By doing so, we can build up our defenses against them and, hopefully, learn how to harness the power of words to spur positive change – both for ourselves and for the people around us.

Austin, TX, EUA|Dear Spanish: You’re Sexist, Let’s Fix That|5:30pm|5:15pm|Fairmont Congressional A|In the wake of #metoo and LBGTQ movements, Spanish-speaking creatives are struggling with the painful reality that their language is sexist, discriminatory and grossly stereotypical—and so they’re forced to counteract it with the most valuable thing in their toolbox: creative ingenuity. Spanish is not an inclusive, gender-neutral language and must adapt to the times. Adjectives, pronouns and nouns are either masculine or feminine You talk about a “niño” or a “niña” and if you want to refer to them in plural, then “niños” takes over. Stereotypes are reinforced, as is the case with words for secretary and cheerleader. Which means creatives have to pay attention to every word, and magic workarounds to ensure they’re reaching targets in a way which doesn’t alienate anyone.

This lab challenges and often upends what we think we know about things in our lives. It's where 2D flat pasta springs to 3D life once it's in boiling water, and a jacket made of an adaptive, transformative material reacts to humidity and body temperature -- and responsively ""vents"" when worn.

They now ask ‘could JFK win the next Presidential race’? If AI can bring JFK’s voice to a generation who had never heard him, could it bring back his decisions, morals, & policies? Could we then apply them to make him, or any AI, a viable candidate for the Presidency? Ludicrous and immoral as it seems, some consider AI-driven political leadership a viable option, based on the fact Ai is logical and rational rather than emotional - and aren't those great qualities in any leader? Which leads us to ask: just because AI could create political leadership, does that mean it should happen? How do we establish the rules for AI and how it influences decision making?

Through her photography, Parker aims to inspire both boys and girls to be their best selves - to challenge and test their limits, to nurture their curiosity and intellect, to find strength in being creative and kind, and to accept the multitudes contained within themselves. It is this perspective that Parker brings to her work with brands, such as American Express, REI, Disney and Athleta, as she helps them find an authentic, unexpected, and disruptive vision that will resonate with consumers by challenging their expectations of what it means to be masculine and feminine in today's world.

However, it is precisely because of this early stage of development that engineers and mathematicians need to talk about the real, down-to-earth implications of imbuing their algorithms and models with ethical considerations. We will discuss these, specifically for supervised, unsupervised and reinforcement learning, and will share some flops and bloopers from both sides of the border. We will then finish this talk with 3 frameworks for ethical modelling.Programming descriptions are generated by participants and do not necessarily reflect the opinions of SXSW."|30.26204559999999|-97.7381328
1662|Mar 13, 2019|101 Red River. Austin, TX, EUA|Privacy and Humanity: Terms and Conditions May Apply|12:00pm|11:00am|Fairmont Congressional A|Human behavior can be considered instinctual and “hard-wired” on many levels – the need for food when hungry, connection when lonely, safety when threatened.  But sometimes the speed of technological change makes it hard to predict how our biology – and our culture-driven impulses – will respond.  Online privacy is one such area.  How do our stone-age minds determine how much privacy we really need?  And more important, what happens when those boundaries are crossed?  Anthropology and Evolutionary Psychology offer clues as to where we draw the line between privacy and disclosure.  By focusing on our hard-wired instincts, we’ll be better able to address the current moment, and understand how expectations of privacy may evolve to fit our online lives, the digital world, and technology.

However, audio contains much more information than that. There are millions of sounds we hear every day such as footstep, coughing, dog barking, and music, and making sense of any sound we hear every day is called machine listening. Current AI systems can't understand what's going on around them, but this emerging sound cognition technology can make them understand the context to provide appropriate service on time, also open up new possibilities for creative applications. In this session, he will introduce the concept of machine listening and what kind of new services, user experience, and musical/artistic expression can be made based on this technology.Programming descriptions are generated by participants and do not necessarily reflect the opinions of SXSW.|30.26204559999999|-97.7381328

This technology is on the verge of fruition, yet yesterday’s policies are preventing tomorrow’s innovations (and economic growth). Steps need to be taken to develop regulation that encourages creative transportation technology, while offering a clear path to compliance to operate with guardrails, rather than roadblocks.

No longer a form of 3-D expression, clothing can interact with our (sub)conscious and regulate our emotions. Sensory input, voice, and brainwaves can already interact with a garment’s look & feel, structure, and sound. Practical applications in the not-too-distant future include: training for concentration improvement, detecting early-stage disease, soothing distressed children, and even intergalactic communication. While emojis have been a popular emotional language substitute, they will soon become the cave drawings of human/social communication because garments go beyond language. Fed by emotive data and sensory information, garments can develop their own communicative, self-regulating brains that feel for-and-with you.Programming descriptions are generated by participants and do not necessarily reflect the opinions of SXSW.|30.26204559999999|-97.7381328

Yet typical buyers don’t consume ethically, at least not most of the time. So if we care about other people and the environment, why don’t we shop like we do? Two behavioral economists will explain their research into the discrepancy between what shoppers say they want and what they actually buy, while a fair trade goods producer will give the marketers’ perspective.

And while we’re getting better at recognizing the symptoms, our prescriptions are ineffective: Let the market try and figure it out. Or create regulations that are difficult to agree on and enforce. But there’s another solution: rebalance the end user-platform dynamic, using cutting-edge tech and proven business models. Currently, platforms like Facebook have all the tools and control: advanced tracking technology, impenetrable algorithmic systems, ubiquitous AI. But what if end users had the same power? What if users had an entire industry advocating just for them: powerful tools to swat away pernicious bots, protect personal data, and negotiate with platforms.

From emotional performance to eye tracking, marketers are now able to have a precise lecture of engagement across platforms. We invite attendees to see key findings across the test of hundreds of ad videos and their performance with key audiences.Programming descriptions are generated by participants and do not necessarily reflect the opinions of SXSW.|30.26204559999999|-97.7381328

Austin, TX, EUA|Nuance is the New Audience|12:00pm|11:00am|Fairmont Congressional B|It’s not enough to connect with audiences of different cultures through demographics, psychographics, and personas. Multicultural consumers are more nuanced and the media they use requires a deeper connection. Culturally aligned platforms need to understand their audience’s subtleties, speak to them in a way that rings true to their experiences, and serve relevant and convincing content. With a $3.2 trillion dollar spending power, multicultural audiences are setting the tone for media investments, content creation, and marketing efforts. This panel will explore how this audience is changing the media landscape. Learn why culturally aligned platforms and investments matter and how they generate opportunities for content creators and advertisers in underserved markets.

Austin, TX, EUA|The Death of the Clickable Ad|1:30pm|12:30pm|Fairmont Congressional A|With fake news and bot clicks challenging the online ad model, there is something to be said for a world where experience becomes the real ad currency. Free to play, previews, samples, and rewards are enabling consumers to engage with brands on a much deeper level. Consumers demand it and brands are delivering it. But what does this mean for clicks? Has the time for clickable ads and pay-per-clicks come to an end? In this session, panelists will discuss the evolution, and implications, of experiential advertising, and its growth from low-reach, highly-immersive experiences to immersion at scale with applications that encourage consumers to touch and feel the world around them.Programming descriptions are generated by participants and do not necessarily reflect the opinions of SXSW.|30.26204559999999|-97.7381328

From the Ice Cream Museum to flower crown selfies at Coachella, brands use experiential to create IRL moments that create buzz about their brand. But creating and maintaining a community is more than ball-pits and photo-worthy backdrops. How do you ensure engagement, delight and success with consumers? In this session, experiential experts discuss how brands should approach bespoke IRL strategies, including proprietary events and partnerships that will unite communities. By way of choose your own adventure, the speakers will engage with the audience to give a look behind the curtain on the questions to ask when developing an experiential event.Programming descriptions are generated by participants and do not necessarily reflect the opinions of SXSW.|30.26204559999999|-97.7381328

There are many instances when lack of experience can actually even be valuable. It seems that people can be more willing to try new things if they don't have a template to follow whereas if you think you *have* to do something because of theoretical knowledge from an internship or business school you're more likely to follow what's in the plan versus what you intuitively know or see in front of you.

The cross-hairs of Coordinated Disinformation are moving to include high-visibility brands and large enterprises as state and non-state perpetrators weaponize the internet to spread propaganda at scale and precision. Responsible corporate leaders must be prepared to defend hard-won brand reputation and equity. In this panel, authors of the US Senate report and Brand Safety professionals will discuss evolving tactics of coordinated disinformation. 2019 is the year that Disinformation goes well beyond politics.

Austin, TX, EUA|The Double Standard In Sex Tech: It’s Time For Change|3:00pm|2:00pm|Fairmont Congressional A|The most talked about story at CES 2019 was sex tech company Lora DiCarlo standing up against CES after the entity had rescinded a robotics award calling the product immoral, obscene and profane, and then banned them from exhibiting at all. The decision is just one example of a bigger issue that is stifling growth and innovation in tech – not just sex tech. Lora DiCarlo is a brand rooted in sex-positivity, inclusion, and innovation and yet is up against the same double standards that face all women in tech and beyond. This fireside chat with Lora DiCarlo’s founder and CEO will discuss the hurdles of gender bias and censorship of female founders and female lead development and how to work around the old guard. What happened at CES is not new. It's time for change. Programming descriptions are generated by participants and do not necessarily reflect the opinions of SXSW.|30.26204559999999|-97.7381328

Programming in this track is designed to inform attendees about this fast-changing industry, and does not promote the use or sale of illegal drugs. As cannabis legalization continues to gain traction in the US, states have begun to develop laws to regulate it. Cannabis advertising is a controversial area of regulation.

And vice versa. A former teacher and pediatrician, Priscilla Chan will describe how the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative aims to change that by pairing technologists with people on the frontlines -- like scientists focusing on disease prevention, prosecutors working to make the criminal justice system more fair, and teachers struggling to meet the unique needs of every student. Tech alone can't solve the world's most pressing problems, but people can. We just need to work together.

Some immigrants are so passionate about America that they enlist in the military and risk their lives to protect it. At the height of the Global War on Terrorism, over 65,000 immigrants served in the Military. Despite their service, changes to immigration policies have made it more difficult for immigrant service members and their families. In 2018, many soldiers were discharged from the Military Accessions Vital to the National Interest (MAVNI) program without justification. At the same time, the rejection rate doubled for family members of immigrants to receive protection under Parole in Place. When America needed them, immigrants accepted the call to service.

As we grow, we often see questions as an indicator of naiveté, inexperience or poor performance.

In 2017, only 17% of VC-funded startups had a woman founder and between 2012-2014, startups led by African-American women comprised less than 0.2% of all venture deals. How might we go about tackling this huge gap in equity and ensure that future minority and women entrepreneurs don't face the same funding challenges? The answer lies in cultivating a culture of Diversity, Equity and Inclusion in financial systems and addressing implicit bias in investment behavior. In this panel we will examine the role of DEI in Impact Investing and the importance of creating equitable investment ecosystems for entrepreneurs.Programming descriptions are generated by participants and do not necessarily reflect the opinions of SXSW.|30.2650555|-97.7384697

By all accounts, that process could be more politicized than ever, aided by 'Big Data' and technology that will allow map drawers to gerrymander with micro-precision to advantage one political party over the other or favor preferred candidates. But, more than ever, data and technology also could help citizens police the process and crack open the door of the proverbial smoke filled room. This panel will bring together key activists, mapping and data specialists, and legal experts to talk about how citizens can use the new tools that will be available to them in 2021 to help ensure that American democracy is not hijacked.Programming descriptions are generated by participants and do not necessarily reflect the opinions of SXSW.|30.2650555|-97.7384697

What once took years to see how a given policy was affecting a city, it’s becoming increasingly possible to learn in real time on a neighborhood-by-neighborhood, or even block-by-block, basis. Harvard economist Ed Glaeser and his co-authors recently demonstrated how Google Street View, combined with computer vision, can reliably predict things like income and crime down to the city block. But in order to take advantage of this transformative technology, government will have to transform itself to be more adaptive and nimble.

Truly data-driven cultures must empower everyone across the data literacy spectrum to be sustainable. This takes time and effort.

1719|Mar 8, 2019|500 E 4th St. Austin, TX, EUA|The Economic Case for Gender Equality|6:00pm|5:00pm|Hilton Austin Downtown Salon C|In celebration of International Women's Day in 2019, the Minister of Finance and Development Cooperation of Belgium will present on why he has evolved from an unconscious to an active and staunch feminist. De Croo will speak on why gender equality is the answer to many contemporary challenges: from digitization, globalization, and migration to the challenges of an aging population. Gender equality is not only the morally right thing to do, but it also makes economic sense. Societies with gender parity have faster-growing economies and gender-diverse companies are more productive with better bottom-lines. And just as importantly,  gender equality will not only liberate women but also men. In order to succeed, we need more male feminists and a new wave of feminism: governments have to get rid of unfriendly women policies; companies have to open up on the gender pay gap and put more women in leading roles; societies have to question and fight (unconscious) bias. In order to make these changes possible, the digital transformation offers us a unique window of opportunity. For the first time in economic history, brains and creativity are more important than muscle and sweat. If we are serious about changing lives, De Croo explains how and why gender equality can become a top priority in all sectors of society.

But they also know it won’t be easy and will require a thoughtful, rules-based approach. A lot has changed since Cameron and Tyler first got involved with bitcoin in 2012: Gemini, the regulated cryptocurrency exchange and custodian they launched in 2015, recently passed its three-year operating anniversary and hit many milestones in 2018—from releasing a highly anticipated mobile app and securing digital asset insurance to helping to stand up the Virtual Commodity Association and launching a controversial ad campaign. Cameron and Tyler have weathered the rise and fall of the price of bitcoin—and the chaos that came with both the highs and lows—but have never wavered in their belief that bitcoin is better at being gold than gold. In this session they will discuss what’s on the horizon for Gemini and the crypto industry in 2019, why they’re focused on building trust, and why they believe the current ‘crypto winter’ will be a time of lasting innovation.

In this session we will introduce 2 case studies where such DNA was used successfully for the recovery or revival of an area. The first case is Nagaoka city in Niigata prefecture where a M6.8 earthquake occurred. The totally devastated city was rebuilt with its traditional “doma” (dirt floor) DNA for their city center. The second case involved the revival of a deteriorating under-populated town, Kamiichi in Toyama prefecture. This town experienced revival when an anime movie decided to use the town as their backdrop. Kamiichi’s DNA thus found its way into the virtual world which had a rejuvenating impact on the real world.

Many organizations are flaunting the ethical standards they’ve created for AI and are trying to show that they're on the right side of history. But rules are needed to ensure automation is beneficial for all of society, and to prevent untenable concentration of power and wealth. Functional regulation is a reachable target. The AI industry, academia, and civil society are currently in dialogue with government to establish an ethical framework for AI but we still need concrete steps that go beyond elf-regulation. Regulation must also have teeth, and can't come as a hopeful suggestion for how businesses should act.

AV companies and fleet operators such as Ford, GM, and Lyft are testing and deploying on public roads in cities – a trend that will continue until self-driving cars are commonplace.  AVs have the potential to greatly impact many of the strategic outcomes cities care most about – such as equity, accessibility and inclusion. However, a provider’s go-to-market strategies and business needs may or may not match up to what a city wants.  Is there a way we can both get what we want? The City of Austin’s AV Expert will ask a panel of AV companies a series of questions similar to that of the popular TV game show of old.

Actors, comedians, musicians, athletes and other entertainers and influencers use their platform and visibility to bring attention to important issues, and fans and consumers increasingly expect their favorite artists to speak out against oppression and injustice. As pop culture's success in shifting public sentiment rapidly grows and becomes more powerful, how do celebrities craft their strategies and tactics in pushing for social change? How do artists decide when and how to get involved with organizations and issues and what does that process look like? What does a successful relationship look like? How do they convince people to care about the issues they hold so dear and encourage more people to use their platforms for good?Programming descriptions are generated by participants and do not necessarily reflect the opinions of SXSW.|30.2650555|-97.7384697

The session will be discussing the idea of how play can exist in everyday spaces, and encourage people to think about these spaces that could become PLAYces: like a crosswalk, bench, building facade, sidewalk, bus stop, or just the everyday space in-between.

For the EU, data is something to be protected; for China, data is something to be controlled; the U.S. sees data as something to be commercialized. Fasten your seatbelt as we examine global extremes in privacy protection, what it means for Internet governance and citizen's rights, and how global tech companies should navigate this complex landscape.Programming descriptions are generated by participants and do not necessarily reflect the opinions of SXSW.|30.2650555|-97.7384697

Cyberspace has no bounds or limits, borders or walls, it becomes more crowded each day only increasing the threat and risk. In 2016 DHS understood how malign actors could undermine our democracy by disrupting our cyber space, more specifically, our elections systems. DHS is the lead in election security and tremendous progress was made working with our federal partners, our elections community and private sector in a short span of a year to ensure our 2018 midterm elections were secure and upheld the public trust in our democracy. It is vital to continue discussing cyber security best practices, lessons learned and the importance of information sharing.

It is a once-a-decade head count of everyone living in our country that has a major impact on our lives. The census is used to determine such critical things as the number of seats each state has in the US House of Representatives and to how we distribute billions in federal funds to local communities. As we approach the 2020 Census, it is already fraught with major challenges. Do we have enough resources to adequately execute the census? How will the attempt to add a citizenship question impact the census? What issues exist as we shift to a digital census regarding privacy and digital access for all communities? How would a census undercount impact the country? Hear local and national leaders discuss what lies ahead for the 2020 census and what you can do about it.Programming descriptions are generated by participants and do not necessarily reflect the opinions of SXSW.|30.2650555|-97.7384697

But as business becomes more purpose driven, many entrepreneurs are looking to launch products for social good – sometimes intentionally and others serendipitously as a result of “tinkering.” Panelists will discuss how non-profit organizations can leverage unique products coming out of these programs to engage their constituents, how social entrepreneurs can get involved in accelerator programs, and how accelerators can add purpose driven innovation to their portfolios.

The internet’s pervasiveness has made many believe privacy no longer exists and we are made vulnerable by the internet.

1765|Mar 9, 2019|500 E 4th St. Austin, TX, EUA|A Global Tour of Disinformation On Social Media|4:30pm|3:30pm|Hilton Austin Downtown Salon C|As part of their manipulation of the 2016 U.S. presidential election, Russian trolls studied the political thriller series House of Cards for insight into the psyche of the American public and the machinations of DC politicians. This cadre of state-sponsored trolls, officially named “The Internet Research Agency,” worked tirelessly for over a decade to embed themselves in the U.S. online community -- in pockets of social media where their manufactured opinions and fake news allowed them to influence citizens to be more polarized and even to take to the streets in manufactured protest. But the trolls aren’t just in Russia -- there are disinformation campaigns across the globe, from India and Ecuador, to Mexico and France. In this session, Camille Francois, Chief Innovation Officer at Graphika, will walk through what a modern disinformation campaign looks like, who the players are in global disinformation, and the tactics they use to manipulate information online and foment unrest among an unwitting public.

But when regulators are involved, it’s a much more complex and nuanced story. Innovators in certain industries have to be particularly mindful of these frameworks and rulemaking efforts, working between guardrails that—while often created with the best of intentions—can sometimes feel restrictive, archaic, counterintuitive, or all of the above.

What many don’t consider is that these platforms were made by men, causing all major online spaces to cater to the male user. These platforms are typically public, subjecting women to bullying, trolling and harassment––83% of young women report this as a problem in their lives. As a result, women are combatting a sexist internet by moving behind “closed doors” and building new platforms away from the public crowd. They’re participating in closed discussion groups tailored for them, finstas (fake instagrams), and 1:1/group private messaging. This panel will discuss the emergence of female-focused platforms and how spaces that prioritize women’s needs (safety, authenticity, and empathy) will disrupt the Internet entirely.

In an increasingly urbanized and motorized world, prioritizing people over cars, and children over high speeds saves lives and money. Cities that are safe for children are safe for everyone – but right now road traffic injuries are the leading killer of adolescents worldwide. Unsafe roads prevent access to education, healthcare and economic opportunities that can lift families out poverty. The health, economic, and social consequences are dire. Roads are the veins through which the health of our society flows, but we are clogging them with traffic jams. It does not have to be this way. We can achieve a world with zero road fatalities, creating safe and healthy journeys for all children through data driven, cost-effective choices.

Biking is considered to be a solution. Most efforts to increase biking in cities focus on hardware, e.g. infrastructure improvements or bike sharing solutions. While this is an important aspect, it ignores other, human-centric aspects of bike adoption. Investments and initiatives should take into consideration the triggers and inhibitors of peoples’ willingness to use a bike in the city for maximum results.  Taking a behavioral economics study in Berlin and San Diego as a basis, this session will provide recommendations for cities globally on how to make more people ride bikes.

Blooming highlights the importance of presence and physical connection in our lives. The installation, which takes the form of a life-size cherry blossom tree, responds to physical contact between two to four participants. When participants stand before the tree and hold hands or embrace, the tree will flourish; when they release, it will wither into its pre-bloomed state.  Park’s work is augmented by advanced research at Nokia Bell Labs into sensor technology that enables the detection and determination of contact between people. Blooming was developed during the 2017-2018 Experiments in Art & Technology (E.A.T.)

The public was outraged at Facebook for not protecting their personal data, but members on both side of the aisle didn’t seem up to the task of questioning Mark Zuckerberg. Unfortunately, data privacy seems to be only the latest technical topic that Congress has struggled with. So, while Congress considers future steps to take on technical issues, Congress should reinstate its own think tank of engineers that used to advise them on emerging technology: The Office of Technology Assessment.

Drawing on his new book, Palaces for the People, Klinenberg shows that when social infrastructure is robust, people are more likely to build ties with friends and neighbors and to invest in their communities; but when it is neglected, as it has been recently, families and individuals must fend for themselves. The presentation highlights innovative infrastructure projects that address challenges like climate change and crime while also building social cohesion.

He believes that the attitude of the immigrant and the entrepreneur are synonymous: bravely venturing into the unknown, always striving to be better. In fact, 60% of the United States’ most highly valued tech companies were founded by first or second generation immigrants. Andre stands tall on the issue and will walk through his own journey and highlight the many parallels between immigrants and innovators to prove that immigrants, in fact, are creating jobs, not stealing them.

If knowledge is power and data is now the most valuable commodity on the planet, who has it? Who uses it? Who controls it? How? And where does government fit into this datascape? Do governments have any power or purpose left, or, like one of those old Western towns that are only facades, are we living in a facsimile of civic governance?

Tosca Musk created an OTT platform for consumers of romance content, mostly women and overlooked.  After brewing kombucha in her closet, Daina Trout ""followed her gut"" to co-found Health Ade.

As products have gone from being delivered in a box to being delivered over the Internet, there's been a dramatic shift in how customers consume, demand, and interact with products. The challenge today isn’t delivering more products and features, but uncovering what to build. The only way to do this is to engage your customers continuously.

Even the integrity of our country’s electoral process is at risk. Data breaches are in the news almost daily, impacting millions of consumers and costing companies millions of dollars. Computer technologies have advanced at a rapid pace, rendering commonly used approaches to cybersecurity obsolete. Radical new technologies like quantum computing will bring equally radical challenges to cybersecurity. This makes protecting crucial systems a daunting task at a time when there is a shortage of talent in the field. Who will we rely on for the next wave of cybersecurity protections? Are startups in the best position to adapt to these rapid developments? We’ll talk with three entrepreneurs from right here in Austin on this topic.

Blooming highlights the importance of presence and physical connection in our lives. The installation, which takes the form of a life-size cherry blossom tree, responds to physical contact between two to four participants. When participants stand before the tree and hold hands or embrace, the tree will flourish; when they release, it will wither into its pre-bloomed state.  Park’s work is augmented by advanced research at Nokia Bell Labs into sensor technology that enables the detection and determination of contact between people. Blooming was developed during the 2017-2018 Experiments in Art & Technology (E.A.T.)

However, disputing a lawsuit typically requires a trip to the courthouse during business hours. Those who live far from the courthouse, have limited mobility, and have inflexible work schedules are more likely to receive a negative judgment because they failed to appear in court. This can threaten homes, family stability, livelihood, and access to justice.  In 2018, Utah became the first state to build an online dispute resolution tool—a website that allows users to manage small claims cases online. This new technology changed the way Utah courts do business. And it was not easy. Leaders from this Utah initiative will discuss the challenges they faced, including technology, skeptics, and maintaining the rule of law.

While these advances make most people’s lives easier, couldn’t we be using tech to disrupt something more? It’s yet to be proven whether tech has the power to disrupt one of the greatest challenges facing humanity: poverty.

As citizens we expect fast, easy-to-use government services like we get from the private sector. Thankfully, government services around the world, led by Estonia and New Zealand, are increasingly automated and personalized, leveraging customer-centred design, big data and AI.

But the reality is most companies rely on a decades-old global manufacturing process of spreadsheets, late-night phone calls to Asia, and far too much hand-wringing. With tariffs and legislation increasingly becoming trade levers, the global supply chain is becoming increasingly difficult to manage. This talk from manufacturing innovator Dave Evans will break down how tech can help companies better navigate an uncertain global trade future. Like financial services, retail, travel and other industries before it, he will make the case for why manufacturing needs its tech moment now.

We have seen their handiwork in France, Mexico, Germany and other places. Between now and SXSW we will see elections not just in the United States but in Brazil and Georgia where on-line manipulation of opinion is already a big problem. When we meet, elections in Indonesia, India and Europe will be just around the corner.  Panelists will talk about where things stand, explore what's working and what's not from the perspective of the world's largest social media platform, the media, and a think tank working to create a network of experts to combat the issue.

In 2017, a ship traversed the Arctic Northern Sea Route without assistance from ice-breaking vessels for the first time ever, signaling a brand new scientific challenge. To understand how the wide-scale changes occurring in the Arctic will bring changes to natural, social, cultural and economic systems, a vast array of data and technology need to be generated to explore this unknown area. A vital piece to helping us navigate the new reality means working with the Arctic’s Indigenous people who have detailed, irreplaceable knowledge of the region and how it has changed over time. The wealth of data generated by this multi-pronged research endeavor can be mined by researchers around the world, creating a global think tank for possible world-changing solutions to a complicated issue. France Córdova, the Director of the National Science Foundation, will describe the next generation of research happening in the new Arctic, from learning more about shipping routes in iceless summers to autonomous robot sensors that will dive deep under the surface to provide constant environmental monitoring.

Still, public understanding of the techniques employed to accomplish these digital intrusions remains stagnant. Meanwhile, technology systems continue to grow in complexity as layers of abstraction enable building intricate systems without fully understanding the supporting technology. These realities cumulate into an inability to properly defend information assets. In other words, things get “hacked” because we don’t understand what we are protecting or who we are protecting it from. To combat this digital fog of war modern enterprises deploy Red Teams to simulate the adversary. In this session, learn how and why it pays to play the bad guy.

From automating analytics to shortening the process of online discovery, we’ve been interacting with A.I. without even knowing it. As such, the labelling of A.I. is simply not accurate enough.  In this panel conversation, experts in A.I. will dive one layer deeper into the technology in order to differentiate between the two primary types in our lives – Passive A.I. and Active A.I. They will discuss the increased role of both in our everyday lives, and will explore the opportunities A.I. can create and the possible outcomes that will radically change the ways we interact with technology.

Blooming highlights the importance of presence and physical connection in our lives. The installation, which takes the form of a life-size cherry blossom tree, responds to physical contact between two to four participants. When participants stand before the tree and hold hands or embrace, the tree will flourish; when they release, it will wither into its pre-bloomed state.  Park’s work is augmented by advanced research at Nokia Bell Labs into sensor technology that enables the detection and determination of contact between people. Blooming was developed during the 2017-2018 Experiments in Art & Technology (E.A.T.) Artist Residency program at Nokia Bell Labs, in collaboration with NEW INC, a program of the New Museum.Programming descriptions are generated by participants and do not necessarily reflect the opinions of SXSW.|30.2650555|-97.7384697

It most often happens imperceptibly  — a tenth of a degree increase in temperature, a few less inches of rain, a slowly melting ice sheet. Over six months in 2018, Reuters embarked on a project to document the challenges and successes of a group of scientists studying Greenland and how the island contributes to rising seas. Through a multi-part series incorporating video, drone and still photography, 3D graphics, data, satellite imagery and animation, Reuters visualized the scientific efforts to track global sea level rise and the inherent difficulties these scientists must overcome.   In this session, we will hear from NASA scientist Josh Willis on how he and his Oceans Melting Greenland (OMG) team chase the research needed to understand the extent of which warming oceans are melting coastal glaciers. The OMG research is part of a cutting-edge effort to narrow the wide gaps in sea level rise prediction models. Reuters photographer Lucas Jackson will discuss his experience documenting the OMG mission and how he managed to capture on a separate expedition, a rare and mesmerizing sighting of sea level rise when a four-mile-wide chunk of ice broke away from the Helheim glacier in southeastern Greenland.

Yet despite the incredible research, documentation, and reporting actively underway, a large portion of the public continues to resist the realities and implications of the changing global climate. In order for science and tech solutions to reach commercial viability, the public must accept the uncomfortable, evidence-based truths being presented and ultimately become proactive partners in adapting to a new normal. Understanding how the human brain processes unpalatable information is the first necessary step in ensuring broad support and adoption of innovations such as a genetically modified salmon, salt water resistant crops, and many other advances born from the necessity to adapt to a rapidly changing environment. This talk will explain how our cognitive shortcomings can and must be overcome to not only survive, but also to thrive.

FinTech companies have been pushing the financial space forward by using technology to reshape services that were once exclusive to banks and financial institutions.

But if investors decide to ‘play it safe’, can creatives and the organisations they work with continue to take risks and work towards uncertain outcomes? And without supported opportunities to experiment with new technologies - from immersive to AI - is there a danger that artists will struggle to compete with others in the entertainment and leisure market? Will they become irrelevant to future audiences? This panel asks: how can we continue to support cutting edge innovation at the interface of creative expression and technology and overcome our fear of failure, and what can public funding bring to the table that the commercial sector can’t?

While the statistics are startling, analyses of diversity in tech must push past existing deficits to address broader implications for the future of the Black community. Exclusion from high paying tech positions coupled with automation that will eliminate jobs outside of the tech industry threatens the community’s economic future. And barriers to tech jobs and startup funding hinder innovation that meets the social needs of the Black community.

Meanwhile, today's automakers and new tech entrants are racing to develop the car of the future, which will look and drive nothing like those classic cars or even much like those of today. This highlights that while the automotive landscape has evolved over the past 100+ years, in just the next 10 years there will be a sea change that significantly alters its course. Electrification, autonomy, and shared mobility are at the core of this change, and how we interact with cars will also change significantly. Fully connected smart cars will seamlessly integrate into our lives and be a natural extension of our habits. Just like our phones today, we won’t be able to imagine our lives without them.

We’re entering a new age when, instead of achieving behavioral change mainly through regulation, personal adoption of technologies can incentivize positive outcomes for all of society.  Rewarding individuals for doing what is in the best interests of the group – such as allowing data from vehicles to be anonymized, aggregated, and transformed into information that can help all who travel on, build, and oversee the roads make safer decisions based on weather, road conditions, infrastructure design, congestion, and more – is a new, powerful way to achieve road safety.

I built a team and sold albums directly to my community. This session is going to dive deep into the trials and tribulations, and hidden time-sinks of using crowdfunding platforms like Kickstarter and Patreon; but also the hidden gold. Over time, my use of crowdfunding and lack of reliance on the ""system"" has meant an unexpected freedom in art-making which has, in turn, kept my connection with my fanbase alive and authentic, with less focus on what I'm Selling and more focus on what I'm Making. And, more importantly, on the connection between artist and audience as a transcendent - and necessary - part of this strange ride we call Life.

The talk will use the gravitational epi-centers of black holes, as a tool for looking past chaos in a system, not to be in line with the biggest trends of tomorrow, but rather, to embody and to set them.  Like the center of a supermassive black hole, we are being drawn towards a future still unclear, with space travel, quantum computing and perhaps even contact with other intelligent life forms, becoming an everyday normality.

Google, Uber, Tesla and a host of start-ups have turned their attention to self-driving truck technology for good reason. Self-driving trucks provide a business model that makes sense because the return on investment could happen faster than with self-driving cars. And it has the potential to touch everyday consumers faster than self-driving cars – even those in rural areas. A revolution in goods transportation impacts everyone by reducing costs for products we use every day. The role of truck drivers will transform and the trucking industry won’t be hampered by a driver shortage. All of these potential benefits mean we could see self-driving trucks go mainstream before self-driving cars.

Today over $25M of Kitties have been bought and sold, mostly between players – over 40 teams are building more apps for the same Kitties. At peak, CryptoKitties was over 25% of the entire Ethereum blockchain's traffic. The most expensive Kitty ever was sold for $140K in May to raise money for charity. For the first time, we go behind the scenes on the grittiest details of our launch, our unpopular thesis on how blockchain changes everything (with examples) and where we go from here as entrepreneurs, developers, designers, citizens.

Programming in this track is designed to inform attendees about this fast-changing industry, and does not promote the use or sale of illegal drugs. Women in Cannabis: leading the industrial gender revolution by example   The cannabis space provides the first real opportunity in a generation to build an industry with equity at the forefront of the conversation. In order to create an industry where women are policy leaders, executives and wealth creators, cannabis will need to defy the gender norms we see expressed in every single other industry.  Each and every time we further gender parity in this space, the lessons learned from building a balanced industry are directly applicable to already established industries, like tech and finance, where men traditionally dominate. This fireside chat/presentation, led by Initiative founder Amy Margolis is part strategy session and part deep dive aimed at empowering women to be successful in cannabis, developing actionable mechanisms for building inclusion and equity in cannabis and beyond, and realizing the global impact of more women in positions of leadership and power.

It can bring tremendous healing to our veterans suffering from PTSD. It can help eliminate the dependency on opioids that is killing 130 Americans every single day. It can serve as an alternative treatment option for millions of cancer patients, chronic pain sufferers, and millions of other patients.  But the impact of cannabis goes way beyond its medical and wellness applications.

As states around the U.S. and nations around the world rethink and rewrite their cannabis policies, what is happening to participants in the underground market?

How can communities that have been devastated by criminalization compete with well-funded cannabis corporations? In this panel, we’ll learn from leaders in the cannabis industry who approach these questions from different angles as they attempt to educate communities, create equitable cannabis policies, and incubate entrepreneurs looking to enter the industry.

Credits are not just a way to pay homage to the talented musicians, songwriters, producers, engineers and DJs who created the music. Credits mean that specific individuals have been identified as the makers of that music, and a specific composition has been identified as the song recorded. This also means that digital music services, record companies, publishers and collective rights societies know who to pay, and services can offer enhanced search results. But this system of identifying and connecting creators to music is broken—BIG TIME. Björn Ulvaeus (ABBA, Mama Mia!) and Niclas Molinder, co-owners of Auddly with producer-songwriter-singer Max Martin, and some of their friends have some important news to share with you (especially for producers) that will finally fix the problem.

2000|Mar 14, 2019|500 E 4th St. Austin, TX, EUA|Value and Art In a Tokenized World|4:30pm|3:30pm|Hilton Austin Downtown Salon J|Thanks to blockchain technology, any asset can now be tokenized—from art to royalties to stocks to portfolios. The implications for art are profound and go beyond merely authentication of digital works or tracking provenance. When large or small groups of people can own a piece of an artist’s work, it can fundamentally reconfigure the relationship between artist and audience: what does it mean for both art and artists that the audience can now become owners? Does ownership subvert or enhance the role of the enthusiastic fan or patron? It is worth wondering whether these ways of creating value lead only to increased commercialization of art, or else to a larger pie where more artists can get funded to create more art.

Programming in this track is designed to inform attendees about this fast-changing industry, and does not promote the use or sale of illegal drugs. Certain states legalized buying and possessing cannabis, but unfortunately, not places to use it. Some say we just forgot. Others say it was intentional. Legalizing social cannabis use is now the next frontier in cannabis activisms and new business opportunities.  In most states with legal adult-use cannabis, consumption can only be done in one’s home or other private establishments. Landlords have been evicting responsible adults. Other adults must choose between risking a citation or using cannabis around their children or extended families.  It’s time to treat cannabis and alcohol consumers the same. Learn about the movement to establish places where you can get high and laugh together, places that serve cannabis with live music or comedy, places where everybody knows your name.

2003|Mar 14, 2019|500 E 4th St. Austin, TX, EUA|Beyond Synch: Indie Artists and Brand Integration|6:00pm|5:00pm|Hilton Austin Downtown Salon A|"Almost everyone knows a song placement in a  TV show, indie film, video game, or ad campaign can open doors for artists. But today, these opportunities can go far beyond a straightforward synch. More artists, many of them up-and-coming and independent, are finding themselves in a position to partner and participate in integrated projects with major brands. In mid-summer 2018, LA-based band BEGINNERS was offered an incredible opportunity from New Balance. For the launch of their newest women's running shoe, the brand and their ad agency flew the band to New York, paired them with a team of top Olympic athletes, and created a kinetic, full length music video-meets-advertisement that celebrated sport and music in equal measure. New Balance also helped set up the launch of BEGINNERS’ newest single, ""Start a Riot"", timed to coincide with the release of the campaign in January 2019. Our panel will delve deep into the process, from the initial pitch through to the launch, and we'll discuss how independent artists can plan and prepare to give themselves the best possible chance for success in multi-faceted, fast-moving, and complex planning scenarios in the brand space.

Programming in this track is designed to inform attendees about this fast-changing industry, and does not promote the use or sale of illegal drugs. Sustainability in cannabis has never been more important to the industry. As regulations become more stringent, a pursuit of sustainable cultivation practices helps cannabis growers survive the significant business pitfalls that new operators will see in this industry. Additionally, the cannabis industry will be judged for years to come on its environmental stewardship. Come to this Meet Up to discuss and learn about safe and sustainable commercial cannabis cultivation in a post-regulatory world. When Dr. Robby Flannery began his career in the cannabis industry, he quickly recognized there were two primary problems with typical cannabis cultivation practices: (1) the careless use of poisonous pesticides and plant growth regulators, and (2) the lack of efficiencies that are normally utilized in commercial cultivation of other crops. As more states legalize the sale of cannabis, the allowance of pesticide use in cannabis has all but been eliminated; however, many cultivators still rely on outdated modes of production that are not as efficient as they could be. The unfortunate side effect of inefficiency in cannabis cultivation is a lack of the pursuit of sustainability.

Name, voice, likeness and other elements of an artist’s identity are licensed for a variety of uses, such as concert merchandise, product endorsements, videogames and hologram tours.

This SXSW CLE presentation examines significant court decisions on and key legal principles in artists’ personas, including which state’s right-of-publicity law may apply, the interplay of related federal claims artists may have for unauthorized uses of their personas and how the monetary value of persona rights is determined.

In the recent past, cannabusiness has meant 2 things: the underground cannabis economy and the business of criminalizing people for participating in it. The injustice and systemic racism present in our criminal justice system remain embedded in the collateral consequences faced by people with convictions on their record. These include lack of access to housing, healthcare, and employment. This panel will outline the racist roots of the War on Drugs and focus on the instruments of oppression that persist today, including the militarization of police, deportation, unfair sentencing, and discriminatory housing, healthcare, and employment policies.

Programming in this track is designed to inform attendees about this fast-changing industry, and does not promote the use or sale of illegal drugs. Due to the restrictions on access to cannabis market data, ads and franchising -cannabis businesses are faced with unique challenges. They must replicate their production and labels according to each state’s unique laws. They also must work closely with their compliance department and local regulators in order to adjust products and marketing to account for local laws and preferences.  There is a massive opportunity for brands to own certain categories in the current research vacuum. The current schedule 1 status of cannabis legally limits the knowledge of cannabis medicine bc of a lack of research. This means that everything from anecdotal evidence to sales trends are used to inform product development. Companies that are not willing to pivot and listen to evolving presences will lose.

Assets like gold, real estate, fine art or carbon credits are more difficult to transfer, often leaving buyers and sellers with paperwork and lengthy procedures. By representing physical assets and currency as digital assets on a distributed digital ledger or blockchain, it’s possible to unlock the value of real-world assets and to exchange them in real time.

Today, many have bypassed that path by funding their startups selling tokens directly to investors, which is proving as a great way to raise money without giving up core company ownership or decision-making power. While it’s clear the tech ecosystem benefits from new funding methods, the panelists believe that while token offerings can be legitimate ways to finance startups, they aren’t for every company. Panelists will give their unique perspective on when to consider an offering (e.g. speed, control), when it’s not (e.g. regulatory challenges), and why startups might consider both crypto and traditional financing mechanism to create tomorrow’s next billion dollar business.

While people are afraid of neurological disturbance caused by Cannabis in the youngsters, it can actually heals an old man's brain. For instance, cognitive impairment in Alzheimer's disease models are reduced by activation of the cannabinoid receptors. Curiously, the mean age of regular medical Cannabis patients is above the 50’s, when the neurons become vulnerable due to senescence. I will discuss original data linking the decline of the endogenous cannabinoids and the vulnerability of the aged brain.

But this short-sighted approach creates an adversarial dynamic that benefits no one. “People over profits” has become the battle cry of the disruptor – and it works. If you prioritize customers in the short-term, with an eye on keeping costs low, you create a win-win partnership in the long-term.

2156|Mar 12, 2019|305 E 5th St. Austin, TX, EUA|Andy Jenkins|8:40pm|8:00pm|Antone’s|Hatched in the tradition of Southern culture—unhurried in his art, yet weirdly ahead of the curve by the time he arrives— Andy Jenkins is a joyously idiosyncratic songwriting talent, ripened over years of relative obscurity. 'Sweet Bunch' springs into the world fully-formed, sitting at the crossroads of modernism and timelessness, sensitivity and decision, with the expansiveness and musical drawl of Big Star, the bounce of John Prine, and the curly, perfectly-carved melodies of George Harrison. Each song paints a wild landscape, the mood of a sun setting on a damn good day among friends and favored creatures.   Andy is a kind of unheard counterpoint, originating from the same small scene of independent Virginia youth culture that produced artists like Justin Frye (PC Worship) Natalie Prass, and Matthew E. White, all friends from his teenage years. Produced by longtime collaborator White, with the Spacebomb crew and another old friend, Phil Cook, running hard into midnight, 'Sweet Bunch' was essentially recorded in three days of flow-state, with the drums, bass, keys, and guitars all live and nothing to regret. Backed by some ringers and a very full chorus, Andy’s warm words come bu Programming descriptions are generated by participants and do not necessarily reflect the opinions of SXSW.|30.266128|-97.7403547

Angelica Garcia lends her astonishing voice to her poetically woven musings and statements of intent. In a time when music should stand up and isn’t, she’s an old head on young shoulders and a total anomaly. After an unhappy period with a major label, 24-year-old Garcia has had a fantastic grounding in what not to do and has spent the past 2 years plotting her own sound and vision. The first fruits of her labour, the single ‘Karma The Knife” drifted out recently winning over people drawn to her beat-driven, sharp and persistently melodic pop music.  She’s extremely hard to compare, but there’s certainly elements of Beck, The Beastie Boys, Jack White and Kimbra all through Garcia’s particular kaleidoscopic worldview.  An album is close to completion and is expected in early 2019. Programming descriptions are generated by participants and do not necessarily reflect the opinions of SXSW.|30.266128|-97.7403547

Anyone can assume such a name, but Azniv Korkejian has an experience of what it means, the type of ground it covers. “Moving around so much caused me at some point to feel displaced, to not really belong anywhere and I thought that was a good title.” Her development was shaped by political landscapes and family opportunities, her adult life patterned by paths of her own. Born in Aleppo, Syria to Armenian parents, Korkejian spent her childhood in Saudi Arabia, moving to America when her family won a Green Card lottery. They settled in Boston, then Houston, but she split for L.A. as soon as she could. A casual offer to stay on a horse farm took her to the rolling hills of Lexington, Kentucky, followed by a year in Austin, and a trip east to Savannah for a degree in sound design. Returning to L.A., she discovered a close-knit community of musicians in Echo Park that started to feel like home. Maybe America is just a highway that leads back to L.A. Korkejian works with sound professionally, in dialogue editing and music editing, a slice of Hollywood’s sprawling industry.

The band grew out of the partnership between Richmond-based brothers Michael and Austin York, who were raised by a soul- and funk-loving mother and a father who was partial to rock. Listening. Internalizing. Developing an uncanny understanding of what makes music from different eras great, and how to synthesize it to make something new and precise. Sleepwalkers was formed when the brothers met drummer Alex DeJong. The group’s first show took place in November of 2013, and they’ve since shared stages with The Shins and Matthew E. White, crisscrossed the country in a Lincoln Towncar as part of The Lumineers headlining bill and joined numerous bills with J. Roddy Walston & The Business, who have served as mentors and frequent onstage collaborators.

Introduced to 50 Cent, Eminem, Kanye West, Jay-Z, Nas, Lupe Fiasco, and T.I. by her older brother, Wynne immediately took to the art form.

As a songwriter, Tommy's first successes came from penning #1 hit singles for Freddy Fender on Huey Meaux's legendary Krazy Kajun label out of Houston, Tx.

The duo ran an organic farm in the Shenandoah Valley, toured the mid-Atlantic by bicycle,  and lived in small communities while pursuing modes of alternative education. Their eclectic background is mirrored in Illiterate Light's sound and lyricism, floating between postmodern confusion and vibrant, life-affirming optimism. Formed in the summer of 2015, Illiterate Light transcend expectations of typical rock music through their limitations as a duo. Gorman elevates his gritty guitar melodies and honest lyricism by stomping out thunderous synth bass with his feet as Cochran layers lush vocal harmony and explodes with body convulsing energy around his minimalist standing drum kit.  Gorman and Cochran’s incessant writing, commanding live performance, and near constant touring promise a bright future as they finish their debut album with Vance Powell (Jack White, Kings of Leon, Chris Stapleton) and Adrian Olsen (Foxygen, Natalie Prass).

The base material—silica—was chosen to be as harmless and ubiquitous as possible, and is the main constituent of 95% of rocks on Earth. Climate modeling shows that, by applying the sand in a strategic location of the Arctic, Ice911 can rebuild ice volume, decrease extreme weather, and reduce Arctic and global temperatures.

2194|Mar 9, 2019|111 E Cesar Chavez Austin, TX, EUA|Starving for Darkness: Light Pollution and Wildlife|5:30pm|5:15pm|The LINE Onyx Ballroom 1|Darkness is disappearing from the face of the Earth, blinding wildlife in the light. While humans may experience light pollution, this loss of darkness is also replaced by other forms of information from the digital world. For wildlife, the loss of information from the night’s sky and natural daylight cycles is simply a void. Moreover, artificial light disorients, distracts, and fixates wildlife, while also shifting the concept of time and falsely triggering instincts developed over lifetimes of evolution. From microscopic organisms such as Zooplankton, to some of the largest organisms on Earth such as Whales, the language of light is becoming uninterpretable to wildlife. This session discusses wildlife examples and case studies, both harmful and helpful, of how to address light pollution.

The longer they are missing the greater the possibility that they might be trafficked, sexually exploited, or abused. ICMEC’s Global Missing Children’s Network (GMCN) recently launched the “GMCNgine.” An innovative, intelligent platform that integrates and searches a vast array of global data sets, looking for matches and other clues to quickly resolve missing children cases - a system as tireless in its efforts to help locate missing children as are the loved ones who search for them.

Yeah—and so did everyone else. And little by little, we’re ruining these picture perfect destinations. Bucket list stops like Machu Picchu, that spot in Thailand where ‘The Beach’ was filmed, and the city of Venice, are trying to find ways to combat the overtourism that risks ruining them permanently. Amsterdam, for example, has created an app that will show you lesser-known (but equally fascinating) alternatives to popular destinations. Instagram influencers have stopped geo-tagging their photos. Others are changing regulations to make travel to their city more expensive. This panel will deep dive on the issue and discuss who is responsible, what can be done—and needs to be done—to save these destinations.

While much attention has been paid to the high-profile women who sparked the cultural reckoning, the most vulnerable women – on farms, and in fields, hotels, and homes – remain in the shadows, even as #MeToo has taken root across the globe, from India to Ecuador to South Korea. For decades, CARE® has led innovative programs that lift women’s voices, give women choices, and empower women workers to ignite transformational change. As part of the Make #March4Women campaign, CARE is demonstrating how to break down barriers that marginalize women around the world.

In this session, Co-Founder, Mike Rothman, will shed light on how Fatherly, the digital media brand for dads, redefines success in a tumultuous media landscape.

She discovers a whole world of parents and children who went through the divorce courts and are hurt by this system. They take to social media instead, vent frustrations and seek justice. Children of divorce are using social media to reach judges and asking why they can’t see their mom or dad. Abusive text messages from bitter exes go viral. Such posts have power in court proceedings and even create virtual mobs. On the other end, some use social media to search for and reunite with families estranged after divorce. This talk features real posts & tweets to illustrate how divorce impacts us all, and how we can make separations within families a healthier experience.Programming descriptions are generated by participants and do not necessarily reflect the opinions of SXSW.|30.2626651|-97.74362239999999

Yet, as digital economies grow, too many people are being left behind. Increasingly, consumers and employees expect brands to embrace sustainable and purpose-driven corporate social responsibility (CSR) programs while offering solutions that advance equity and economic mobility.

How are interfaith collaborations being used today in the fight for immigration rights? Documentary filmmakers from across the country covering the stories of undocumented immigrants who take Sanctuary, and the faith communities who have made places of worship available to them, will discuss the methods and challenges of filmmaking around their work.

My Brother’s Keeper, an initiative launched by President Barack Obama in 2014, is one of the organizations addressing the opportunity gap to ensure that all young people can reach their full potential. Data has shown us the gaps between boys and young men of color and the rest of the population when it comes to education, earnings, health, employment, neighborhood safety, workforce development and encounters with the law enforcement and justice system. By organizing and presenting local data in a way that supports policy and system change and increases accountability, we can consider data as a potential solution when it comes to racial disparities.

It is a concept defined by acts of kindness performed to perfect or repair the world and in modern times, it has become synonymous with the notion of social action and the pursuit of social justice.

Predators of press freedoms are building a tracked and censored internet, while blocking external content. Democracies are undermined while despotic regimes develop intricate propaganda machines that silence dissent, locally and globally. Solutions are badly needed to strengthen journalism & the integrity of public debate. That’s why Reporters Without Borders has launched a global appeal to mobilize governments and those committed to defending a free and pluralistic public space, essential for democracy. Seventy years after the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, a Commission of 25 influencers from 18 countries has published an International Declaration on Information and Democracy to establish basic principles for information in the digital age - “a common good of humankind.”  Programming descriptions are generated by participants and do not necessarily reflect the opinions of SXSW.|30.2626651|-97.74362239999999
2214|Mar 11, 2019|111 E Cesar Chavez Austin, TX, EUA|Effective Religious and Civic Leadership|4:30pm|3:30pm|The LINE Topaz Ballroom 1-2-3|Effective religious and civic leadership in the United States requires a thorough understanding of the First Amendment principles that govern the relationship of religion and government, define protections for the free exercise of religion, and provide the civic framework for living among people of all religions and none. Unfortunately, many leaders receive little or no civic education about the history and significance of the religious liberty clauses of the First Amendment. As a result, many Americans are misled about the constitutional role of religion in public life, confused about the meaning of church-state separation, and uncertain about the limits of the free exercise of religion. Having the ability to facilitate dialogue is a key leadership skill for the 21st century. As sharp ideological divisions continue to polarize our communities, we need leaders who have the skills to engage people and communities who hold a variety of legal, ideological, religious and nonreligious perspectives. By applying this constitutional framework, leaders will be able to forge a shared understanding of the place of religion in public life and work together to sustain America’s bold experiment in living with our deepest differences. The Religious Freedom Center of the Freedom Forum Institute is committed to promoting dialogue and understanding among people of all religions and none.

Crazier sounding still, these gangs have written mission statements, vision statements and key values that all of us would be proud to align with. Not as surprising, gang members are resilient people with critical business skills like sales, operations, finance and leadership. They’re an unused workforce, a potential change agent with strong influence in the inner cities. TRU Colors Brewing is an example of startups tackling big social issues.

Deep, spiritual connection — to each other and to the Divine, aka Source, aka All That Is — isn’t “owned” by any particular faith. And it doesn’t have a financial cost. But it does take practice. It takes time. It takes a willingness to operate your life in a counterculture way: to be a spiritual contrarian, if you will. On the other hand, the rewards of spiritual practice are delightful: freedom, growth and joy. The ability to trade fear and doubt for confidence. The ability to trigger creative flow and take intellectual risks on demand. These rewards show up in every area of our lives: health, wealth, wisdom and, especially self-expression. Inner Wellbeing is what Tara-Nicholle Nelson calls the upgraded, uplifted thoughts, emotions, actions and inner narratives that change our outer lives.

Whether it’s those being separated from their families under family separation laws, those struggling to gain access to asylum in the US after fleeing domestic violence situations, those unable to access proper reproductive care abroad, or those banned from entering the country under current travel policy, women continue to be on the receiving end of policies largely created and enforced by men. This panel will give an intimate and firsthand look at the ways in which these and other US border policies and immigration laws are impacting women around the world and, importantly, what’s next.

Folks want to talk like us. But do they want to hear us speak -- or at least provide us with the resources to do so? With the exception of a handful of conversational and comedic podcasts, hosts of critically acclaimed shows usually drop the blaccent in favor of a more NPR-ish style of speech. Where is the disconnect? Does it matter that there is one? This panel will explore: the dearth of podcasters with blaccents, inaccessibility for podcast creators and listeners who favor AAVE, and the importance of putting resources into audio series that exist outside of the NPR mold.

The smart technology push seems to be stuck on monitoring and control [of iconic intelligent lampposts] while siloed thinking and acting, still the norm in many cities worldwide, obstruct the development of meaningful and scalable solutions for urban challenges.  This panel puts a case to reassess the holistic design approach, with quality of life at the core of the discussion. The shared city should not be the inevitable result of digital revolution but a carefully crafted societal evolution. Steeped in a Dutch Design tradition, three creative thinkers and doers advocate this approach by presenting new design solutions and strategies for collaboration.Programming descriptions are generated by participants and do not necessarily reflect the opinions of SXSW.|30.2626651|-97.74362239999999

Using stories and raw footage from his undercover operations conducted in multiple countries across the globe, Ballard will tell the story of modern-day slavery.  While distinctly different from the singular transatlantic slave trade, the fight against global slavery today can draw many parallels from the Underground Railroad of the 19th century.

2253|Mar 8, 2019|508 E 6th St. Austin, TX, EUA|Flint Eastwood|9:45pm|9:00pm|Palm Door on Sixth|Jax Anderson (aka Flint Eastwood) is a gay alt-pop artist from Detroit, Michigan who has built an international audience by writing great songs and touring with the tireless work ethic that her city is famous for. She is known for her unapologetic fierceness on stage as much as her kindness and smile. She champions authenticity in a world filled with fake news, and plants seeds of empathy in a world that constantly tries to separate us. This approach has led to two top ten singles at indie radio in Australia over the last 12 months, with her latest peaking at #1 and a third song in rotation now. Paper Magazine said her latest release “This Is A Coping Mechanism For A Broken Heart” is as raw as it is expansive: “a modern pop menagerie that’s harder than ever to pin down […] atmospheric synth-pop inflected with R&B and hip-hop notes. There’s Lana in her sorrow and syrupy delivery, Charli in her shimmering hooks, Florence in her folkiness, Sia in her jitters, and HAIM in her breathiness.” It’s a diversity of sonic influences all tied together by an overarching commitment to songwriting that finds its power in vulnerability.

Others take a proactive approach, like JP Morgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon, in addressing the internal cultural barriers that keep a company from fully maximizing the talent of its female employees. And as LeanIn.Org and SuveyMonkey report, a growing number of male managers feel uncomfortable mentoring women today. How are men around the world becoming part of the women’s empowerment movement, in ways big and small? And as men react to #MeToo, is male mentorship of women endangered? Kendra Scott, founder and CEO of a billion-dollar fashion company, Laurie Adams, CEO of Women for Women International, and Zara Martin, Women for Women International Ambassador, TV presenter, actress, model and DJ discuss the role men can and are playing as allies and advocates for women.

Anyone can assume such a name, but Azniv Korkejian has an experience of what it means, the type of ground it covers. “Moving around so much caused me at some point to feel displaced, to not really belong anywhere and I thought that was a good title.” Her development was shaped by political landscapes and family opportunities, her adult life patterned by paths of her own. Born in Aleppo, Syria to Armenian parents, Korkejian spent her childhood in Saudi Arabia, moving to America when her family won a Green Card lottery. They settled in Boston, then Houston, but she split for L.A. as soon as she could. A casual offer to stay on a horse farm took her to the rolling hills of Lexington, Kentucky, followed by a year in Austin, and a trip east to Savannah for a degree in sound design. Returning to L.A., she discovered a close-knit community of musicians in Echo Park that started to feel like home. Maybe America is just a highway that leads back to L.A. Korkejian works with sound professionally, in dialogue editing and music editing, a slice of Hollywood’s sprawling industry.

There is a sense of darkness. But I’m crisscrossing the country, and people are good and fun. There is a lot of beauty everywhere. I think not forgetting that is important. Osborne is home in Charleston, South Carolina, reflecting on the personal journey and cultural climate that have led to Ever Since I Lost My Mind, the third record and label debut for his acclaimed project SUSTO. The album is a resounding triumph: a mix of new partnerships and collaborations with old friends, all anchored by Osborne’s perceptive songs that explore connection, loss, and transience––and the pain and joy each brings.  “Ever Since I Lost My Mind is very personal. This collection of songs came together over the course of a couple of years, and they all represent different moments,” he says. “It felt cathartic writing all of them, and they were also all fun in different ways.” Programming descriptions are generated by participants and do not necessarily reflect the opinions of SXSW.|30.2669107|-97.7377236

The band consists of Kerry Alexander, Chris Hoge, and Connor Davison.  Their music honors classic pop songwriting, with nods to 90s rock simplicity and pop-punk frivolity. Through it all, Alexander’s unflinchingly sincere lyrics cut to the emotional heart of things. The band's sophomore LP ""Lightning Round"", was released August 3rd, 2018. Producer and collaborator Brett Bullion (who also produced their debut album ""Psychic Reader"") encouraged the group to record live in the studio, an approach which lends many songs on the record a loose, organic feel. In this spontaneous environment, the music feels as honest and unpredictable as Alexander’s lyrics. Alexander is still writing love songs, ones that recount with cinematic swell the subtle joy and pain of the everyday. Bad Bad Hats has toured the U.S. extensively since 2015, including tours with Margaret Glaspy, Hippo Campus, Third Eye Blind, The Front Bottoms, and more.

Together, their music is a punchy, psych-tinged, lyrical variety of rock and soul. Los Coast formed like Voltron, and Trey happened to be the heart. He is Los Coast’s “Stax-worthy” vocal feature. To put it simply, “there’s something about Trey’s voice that resonates with you.” He was introduced first to jazz—by his uncle Hiram Bullock—but Trey’s musical enthusiasm embraces gospel, punk rock, folk, and hip-hop, among other genres, and his eclectic songwriting style reflects his catholic musical interests. John is a multi-instrumentalist primarily featured as lead guitar. John’s style is rooted in experimental rock and modal jazz and heavily influenced by an appreciation of music theory developed studying mood, texture, and composition at Berklee College of Music.

The duo ran an organic farm in the Shenandoah Valley, toured the mid-Atlantic by bicycle,  and lived in small communities while pursuing modes of alternative education. Their eclectic background is mirrored in Illiterate Light's sound and lyricism, floating between postmodern confusion and vibrant, life-affirming optimism. Formed in the summer of 2015, Illiterate Light transcend expectations of typical rock music through their limitations as a duo. Gorman elevates his gritty guitar melodies and honest lyricism by stomping out thunderous synth bass with his feet as Cochran layers lush vocal harmony and explodes with body convulsing energy around his minimalist standing drum kit.  Gorman and Cochran’s incessant writing, commanding live performance, and near constant touring promise a bright future as they finish their debut album with Vance Powell (Jack White, Kings of Leon, Chris Stapleton) and Adrian Olsen (Foxygen, Natalie Prass).

Recently relocated to the Netherlands he has already made a major impact on Kurdish music scenes in Europe, collaborating with refugee Kurdish musicians from Syria, creating a novel blend of electronic pop and heavy electrified Kurdish folk music. Having been outlawed for more than a decade, Kurdish music, culture, and language was gradually decriminalized in Turkey through the 1990s. An explosion of creativity resulted in new interpretations of traditional Kurdish folk music central to Kurdish community life and cultural identity. The most influential new genre is called ağır delilo (slow, heavy delilo—a Kurdish folk dance) or in a more pure Kurdish expression—granî (slow and heavy), characterized by heavily distorted elektrobağlama—an electrified long necked lute, which bridges the sonic aesthetics of the shrill reed pipe traditionally used to accompany folk dances with hard rock sounds.

2301||508 E 6th St. Austin, TX, EUA|SHIRAZEE|||Palm Door on Sixth Patio|Born in Benin, schooled in Ghana, pulled into the bustle of the UK, South Africa and Paris, singer songwriter Shirazee found himself in Atlanta with nothing but trialing experiences and a dream of fracturing the juggernaut that is the rap industry. Though vitally settled in the city that bled rap music, a new path would take shape that would soon define his career. That path was songwriting. Though ingrained in his DNA through countless years of artistry, surrendering the pen to the needs of other artists was uncharted territory. This soon led to his departure from the city that represented what seemed like his lifelong dream to the city that sculpts, chisels and molds it. While opportunity was deep-seated in the concrete arms of the rigorous goliath, New York tested Shirazee’s resilience. Overcoming homelessness he soon signed his first publishing deal and found himself at the helm of songs by artists like Sting, Afrojack, Ty Dolla $ign, and more. Fast forward to 2018 and encompassing experience, influence and his widespread musical pallet, Shirazee releases “MAKE WILD”, a feel-great tune that calls for intentness in what has always been his foreordained playground.

Originally formed in 1980, The Chills had a revolving cast of band members with Phillipps remaining the only constant. His knack for writing fantastic pop songs led to chart hits back home and a cult following around the world.  With early releases via the legendary NZ label Flying Nun, The Chills produced a number of critically acclaimed recordings such as the single “Pink Frost” (their first hit) from the compilation album Kaleidoscope World and “Wet Blanket” from the LP Brave Words.

Bree began writing and performing music as a child and by age 13 had released on New Zealand's Flying Nun Records. At age 19 he formed the band The Brunettes, writing and producing 4 albums and 4 EPs for them. The Brunettes went on to sign with Sub Pop before eventually disbanding in 2010. Bree then slipped into the shadows, resurfacing in 2014 as a solo artist with his masked baroque band, and has now released 3 solo albums.

We’re all familiar with that feeling of overwhelm, and the angst of seeing numbers rise on your email inbox, slack, texts, etc. It’s hard to wade through the noise and focus on what matters. 83% of U.S. respondents surveyed by Evernote earlier this year said they use a combined total of 1-4 devices, with 65% using 1-9 applications every day.

Austin, TX, EUA|Serving Each Other |3:30pm|2:30pm|Palmer Events Center Conscious Conversations|"""If you have come here to help me you are wasting your time, but if you have come because your liberation is bound up with mine, then let us work together.”  ― Lilla Watson One of the more wonderful aspects of this modern wellness movement is the deep desire that many practitioners have to be of service.  A recent study on the behaviors of the American yoga community found that yoga teachers are twice as likely to donate their time to their community as the average U.S. adult. About 54% of them do. With all of this positive intention, it is sometimes easy to be unconscious of the importance of approaching community engagement with real self-reflection and social awareness. Often, teachers with wonderful hearts and great intentions, rush into communities that they don't share life experiences with, and are not representative of. This approach to being of service can neglect both the power dynamics that are simply part of the structure of our society, and the careful self-reflection on whether we are the right fit for the parts of the community we are trying to connect with. In this Amala Foundation facilitated workshop, we will explore the meaning of conscious service together through group activities, listening circles, and honest conversation. This session is limited to 30 participants that will break into circles of 10, where each circle will be led by a facilitator.

How do you connect your talents and passion to work that makes you come alive? We have good news, you don't have to struggle to figure out what comes next.

And women are starting businesses at a rate five times that of men.  And yet we rarely talk about the collision of two worlds:  growing companies at the same time you're growing humans.  We hear stories of female founders hiding pregnancies until fundraising rounds are closed and endless accounts of investors questioning the commitment of women in the C-suite with small children at home.  And we do not hear stories of male founders skating questions of babies on the way or toddlers at home.

Con un  ronquido en mi  voz anuncié mi primer sencillo formal en plataformas digitales el 22 de julio de 2018 acompañado de un show en la ciudad de Medellín junto a mi primer sello discografico “574” (de Medellín para el mundo).

The cosmos in Cassandra’s self proclaimed Cosmic American songs are both macro and micro, with nods woven throughout to Hollywood-and-Vine country surrealism in a tapestry that is “tender and trance like” (Interview Magazine). What makes her collection of songs stand out from fellow acolytes of psychedelic burritos and dusty journeys through gilded palaces of sin, is that her vision and scope of influences are broad, idio-syncratic and ever-changing. Cassandra uses the clarity and smoldering sense of longing conveyed by her “smokey vocals” (NPR) to transcend her urban surroundings in order to connect to a deeper, quintessentially American vein of expression that showcases a sophisticated art heart and a mature point of view about the masks and complications of desire.

Asked about her debut album, Norma describes it as an introspective and stubborn quest, a lonely and passionate one, through feminine desire and the struggle for self-acceptance – her own Film Noir, and she's the Fatale heroine.  	Nodding with great sensitivity and playfulness to the sounds of the '90s and '00s, along with a rich musical education (The Beatles and Elvis Costello at her mom's, Marvin Gaye and Gram Parsons, then later on Fiona Apple, Joni Mitchell, Kate Bush), Norma never appears twice the same way. Heady melodies, twisted harmonies, and her own dark groove, velvet vocals and intimate lyrics give the record a timeless unique style, shifting from dark trip-hop to witty RnB, from bestial house to the final country ballad.  	A fiery, independent artist who never shies away from murky waters, Norma takes her time, without concessions. She's releasing her first album “Female Jungle”, co-produced with artist Ryder The Eagle, on her own label Shortcuts.

By letting go, an artist invariably flourishes. Sophie Auster embodies this phenomenon. The New York singer and songwriter leverages the freedom to soulfully speak her mind and share truths by way of vivid songwriting cast over swaths of lush acoustic guitars and dense piano chords. Between ceaseless touring, 2016 saw her achieve the grand prize at The John Lennon Songwriting Contest, while Cosmopolitan Magazine named her “Singer of the Year” in Spain where she also graced the publication’s cover. Along the way, she penned what would become her third full- length album and first release for BMG, Next Time. Emblematic of her growth, the first single “Mexico” plays out like a long lost fifties South-of-the-Border-set film noir. Punctuated by boisterous horns and an irresistible chant, the track illuminates both vocal charisma and a knack for storytelling. Next Time will be released through BMG, March 15th 2019.

She’s a sophisticated, mature writer with a relevant point of view, who has earned a legion of loyal fans through a solid decade of performing.  Her national touring career was launched by a win at the prestigious Kerrville Folk Festival songwriting competition, and her radical reinterpretation of Nirvana’s ‘Come As You Are,’ made her an instant fan favorite on the first season of The Voice on NBC. But timing and delivery alone don’t make an artist. There’s got to be substance as well, and on her new album Loebe fearlessly probes the rawest corners of her psyche to find it. “There's a lot of me talking to myself,” she says. “I’m writing a lot of empowerment jams these days, and I think it's because it's what I need.

Wild!, the new collaboration between Grammy-nominated singer-songwriter Robbie Fulks and rock-and-roll royalty Linda Gail Lewis, gleefully lives up to its title. It’s Americana music that’s as butt-shakin’ as Beale Street, deep-rooted as the Grand Ole Opry, and hip as a trip to The Strip. Subversive as it is reverential, the album jumps the genre tracks of nitty-gritty rock-and-roll, country-and-western, rockabilly, jump swing, and gospel, landing in a strange slice of spacetime—call it 1954—when all these were One (and Linda was 7).  Robbie Fulks, the record’s producer, is “one of the most observant and wry songwriters of the past two decades” (Rolling Stone). Ground-zero Louisiana-born rocker Linda Gail Lewis is the younger sister and frequent performing partner of Jerry Lee Lewis, whose piano innovations she carries forward. Her present-at-the-creation cred buoys the record while Robbie—who sings, plays, leads the band, writes most of the songs, and arranges the others—provides an anchoring sensibility, one that savors old sounds but sidesteps nostalgia. Their two talents have fashioned a record that’s urgent, honest, and fun. Remember fun?

Thrown together purely by accident for an anniversary show at Winnipeg’s venerable West End Cultural Centre, The Small Glories is a partnership that could almost make you believe in fate.  With a stage banter striking a unique balance between slapstick and sermon, these veteran singer-songwriters have a way of making time disappear, rooms shrink, and audiences feel as they are right there on the stage with the band.  It’s not uncommon for listeners to find themselves laughing, dancing, crying, or caught up in a good ol’ fashioned sing-along.  Their material is rootsily welcoming — songs of love, loss, & environment, delivered with soaring, interwoven vocals on various combinations of stomping clawhammer banjo & guitar.

While the two sisters have played music together for their entire lives, it is only now that they are officially banding together.  The upcoming self titled release, ""Delle Sorelle"" allows the listener a glimpse into the intimate world of their sisterhood.

She set poems by Hughes in musical settings of her own construction on the critically acclaimed album, and her plain-spoken voice highlighted the common sense in Hughes’ works. McCalla moved to New Orleans in 2010 to busk on the streets. She also toured as part of the Carolina Chocolate Drops but left to pursue her own music and the project that threaded through it—an exploration of Haiti’s Creole culture and identity. McCalla connected with other Louisiana musicians who work with Creole traditions. That led to 2016’s A Day For The Hunter, A Day For The Prey, which reveals the art and humanity in folk songs. McCalla has kept her instrumentation spare to allow the song to shine, but her upcoming album, The Capitalist Blues, departs from that as she plays with a New Orleans-based band. The Capitalist Blues is different from McCalla’s previous albums, but she hears the connection between New Orleans and Haiti. Many of the themes are extensions of ones she examined on A Day for the Hunter, a Day for the Prey, and even though the lineups are very different, the songs come from the same place.

For the second record the musicians are now even more focussed on their true strengths. Inspired by a trip to Prague they wrote a song cycle called Suprafon. To maintain their focus on record they flew all the way to Austin, Texas to record their new album that is both - a natural evolution and a brand new start. While the energy of the band lingered around the corner on ""Moon Bordeaux“ it is now in full flight on these new songs. Suzan Köcher‘s mystical Psychedelia is infused with beautiful melodies, biting guitars and reverberated synths. Shades of Krautrock, Psych-Folk and French Pop float through the new songs that are at once enthralling and loose. Through many live shows her and her band have developed a unique sound fueled by Suzan´s magical voice, haunting melodies, fearless experimentation and rusty musical instruments that colour their sound in all shades of withered glory.

It's wild yet controlled, contemplative yet loud and elegantly messed up. In 2018 she released the self-produced singles ”Soul Traveller” and ”Into the Blue” and supported bands like Sunflower Bean and L.A. Witch on stage. Warm and piercing vocals float above a sound inspired by country and rock, fuzzy desert sounds and analog synthesizers with a minimalistic touch. Her 6 track EP ”We Gotta Talk” was released in spring 2017, produced by Victor Van Vugt (Nick Cave, PJ Harvey). ""Unfurling with a gentle jangle, the crisp, spring-fresh songwriting can't fail to get under your skin” wrote Clash Magazine. ""Somewhere between The Bangles, Patti Smith and Nots” - according to Cute and Dangerous Magazine. ”Driven and witty, Emma gives us a taste of what Penny Lane from Almost Famous music would sound like.” wrote Indie Berlin and drew parallells to Stevie Nicks.

Being able to record at home only amplified his abilities, and a couple of EPs released on small indie labels attracted the attention of Columbia, who hoped he’d emerge as the next Ed Sheeran. But as comparisons with everyone from Deerhunter, Kurt Vile and Mac DeMarco to Chris Isaak and Lou Reed emerged, it was clear that he was instead destined to be the one and only Willie J Healey. It was a great experience with some ups and downs, but his goal was more simple and remains unchanged – to be able to write songs that he likes and then share them with audiences. His latest EP set to be released by new music champions YALA! Records. Everything is now in place for Willie J Healey to live up to his limitless potential. “I try not to be too aware of trends, so I can focus on writing the best song I can regardless of whether I think it will be cool or not.” He notes how the great albums of the ‘70s feel out of time in contrast to the booming drums and slick production that places many ‘80s records firmly within their era. “A timeless classic will never go out of fashion.” Programming descriptions are generated by participants and do not necessarily reflect the opinions of SXSW.|30.2670696|-97.7407154

Sonically, they shake the walls. It’s dissonance purified. On paper, they could be the kind of band who’d turn decibel levels up at shows just to mess with people’s heads. But there’s a pop pulse running through their songs. For every bolt of raw noise, there’s a sugar coating. The band test the resolve of post-punk, drone and shoegaze, but the end result is a dazzling meeting ground between concrete and candy.

The band came together when singer and main lyricist Laura Hayden moved to London from Barcelona and started writing songs with Josh. “I always wanted to do music but I never had the balls or the knowledge,” she explains. “And when I wanted to start writing, Josh had, er, ""good credentials"".” Those credentials included being in a band with an ex of Laura’s but the chemistry was good and the two soon built up a body of songs, before recruiting Harry and, later, Jackson to the cause. In desperate need of a name to put their songs to online, they picked Anteros - the god of requited love, a landmark in London that united the scattered members in one place and, most importantly, the title of the song that cemented their retro-tinged indie pop sound.

Their story started in Limerick, Ireland. Singer/bassist Aoife Power, guitarist Niall Burns, and drummer Andrew Flood met for the first time as three teenagers after sneaking into Costello’s Tavern: the only bar in town that catered to their musical tastes. After bonding over cheap vodka and the sound of The Velvet Underground, they began playing music together and moved to London.  The bands’ influences feed into a lineage that boasts everyone from The Cranberries to The Pogues. The band acknowledge those great literary songwriters perhaps no more so when they covered ‘Fairytale of New York’ last Christmas, which was immediately reciprocated when Pogues frontman Shane McGowan was singing their praises and invited them to play at his 60th Birthday party.    Fusing that “immigrant song’” sensibility with their love of noise and melody, the group are transforming into a modern day answer to early Blondie or the Pixies. Huge shows alongside the likes of Nick Cave and Patti Smith came this summer. They’ve also supported the likes of Dream Wife, Declan McKenna, The Vaccines, Peace and Blossoms.

After releasing a string of hype-amassing singles in 2017, the four piece decided to do things differently to their peers, and took a considerable amount of time off to hone everything in. They returned with a forward thinking debut EP in tow, which staked their claim as a band ready to explode in 2019. Released in November 2018 via Dirty Hit (The 1975, Wolf Alice, Pale Waves), I Have Love was a remarkable release, tackling a multitude of issues, from dysfunctional family life to abuse and groping at gigs, all centred about love's many forms, but put through the chaotic punk filter that defines the band and their influences. It's an informed, meticulously crafted release that sets the tone for what the Wandsworth quartet can do when they release their debut album later this year.Programming descriptions are generated by participants and do not necessarily reflect the opinions of SXSW.|30.2670696|-97.7407154

Meanwhile her heart-stopping inter-generational music & film collaboration with japanese ambient legend Midori Takada in Le Renard Bleu (with KENZO and Partel Oliva) continues to echo into new forms, with a full production performance titled ‘Ceremonial Blue’ premiering at the Barbican, London in April.  And streaming now, her achingly beautiful self-directed video for JOSEPH - a lullaby and an ode to newborn life co-written with Jamie Woon and also featuring on her debut album, due Spring 2019 - has set Lafawndah apart as an independent director with a singular vision spanning multiple media and artforms.

Before his guitar offered an escape route from North Shields, Sam Fender would roll around its cracked pavements with nothing much to do and nowhere to go. Invariably, he’d be kicking a ball around or smoking cigarettes, always with a song in his head. “I love my hometown, but when I was growing up I did feel trapped,” he begins. “I felt suffocated, it was claustrophobic.” Fender couldn’t stand the inertia, and turned to his guitar rather than his A-Levels to find a way past it. A sense of abandon informs his urgent, heartfelt, already essential rock‘n’roll songs, which tell stories of a life on the fringes.

It is a weapon – peculiar, androgynous, lurching and defiant – that she wields to beautiful, evocative effect. When Guardian music critic Caroline Sullivan saw the band perform at The Great Escape this year, she tweeted, “I'm almost dumbstruck by the singer – she has the strangest, most haunting voice I've heard in ages.” Catrin is delighted that people find it so strange. “A lot of people think I’m a man,” she laughs. “I think people are embarrassed when they initially think it’s one of the guys singing, but I love it. It’s like I’ve got two voices – there’s this soft, whispery voice that can go really high, and then suddenly there’s this angry chest voice. Somewhere along the way, I drew two voices together.”  Catrin’s unusual vocals certainly caught the attention of her future band mates – drummer Max, bassist Naomi and guitarist Jack ¬– when they were studying music together at Goldsmiths University. Before they came together to form Another Sky (which is named after an Emily Dickinson poem), “we were all just drifting,” says Catrin.

Meeting on the road whilst playing in other bands, Kirsty and Sara ran away from their previous lives and now describe themselves as outlaws. Born out of love and a desire of heavier music they burst onto the scene with a stunningly filmed live track and accompanying video, ‘Black Blood’ immediately picking up fans from NME, Clash and BBC Introducing. The band quickly made a name for themselves with their wild attitude, DIY spirit and incredible live shows. Their raw energy and intense delivery has won them fans across the UK and Europe and seen them as an in-demand warm up act for musical giants such as Garbage, The Kills and Skunk Anansie. As one live reviewer put it: “All you can think to do is ask them out for ice cream and all they want to do is wreck your car..."" The bands’ debut LP  ‘Glitter and Spit’ released in 2018 has picked up rave reviews and has been described as ‘Full of attitude, charisma and confidence - it takes the listener on an adrenaline-charged ride.’   The Pearl Harts hold no prisoners and sound like they are about to explode!

Their clever combination of blues, folk and rock n roll has created a distinctive genre of their own. The London-based pair met almost three years ago and have since won over the capital with their ever-growing live presence and songwriting. In 2018, the duo released their highly anticipated EP 'Made In Streatham' which they self-produced in their South London flat. Released through their own label 'Archtop Records', the EP has clocked up millions of plays on Spotify and received widespread praise across the board.

Ewan made hip-hop beats and played with samples, while Callum was working in recording studios and obsessing over the music of Michael Jackson, Curtis Mayfield, Beck and Flaming Lips. Combining their different loves, Bad Sounds are conjuring their own unique pop magic.

But that’s exactly where Apre’s story begins.     Charlie Brown and Jules Konieczny were no strangers to making music individually, but it wasn’t until Sue who runs Ealing chess club (or, to use her full title “this legend called Sue”) suggested they should hook up and work together that the strands that make up Apre’s unique sound started to fuse together.   “She knew that we shared this passion for music and she paired us up,” recalls Brown, “we started playing together and found this love for the same thing.”   However, things didn’t quite immediately leap forwards from that moment to where we are today. Three years passed and Brown and Konieczn would spend their days playing in other groups, producing, working on other people’s material, making ends meet and trying to find their way in music.

One of his granddads was a jazzer who played drums for the Royal Marines. Davey’s dad (violin) and his mum (clarinet) both played, and met, in the BBC National Orchestra Of Wales. Davey himself also enjoyed orchestral engagement, playing in various Welsh Orchestra’s and Jazz bands as a teenager. Davey’s vocals and arrangements carry the tunefulness of The Super Furry Animals. But the palette extends far beyond singer-songwriterly poignancy. Davey recruited friends Daf Davies, Dylan Morgan and Sam Barnes to form the Boy Azooga live quartet, an ensemble that swings smoothly from filmic instrumentals to a churning, rave-tinged rock that hints at both Can and their progeny in Tame Impala.

The band came together when singer and main lyricist Laura Hayden moved to London from Barcelona and started writing songs with Josh. “I always wanted to do music but I never had the balls or the knowledge,” she explains. “And when I wanted to start writing, Josh had, er, ""good credentials"".” Those credentials included being in a band with an ex of Laura’s but the chemistry was good and the two soon built up a body of songs, before recruiting Harry and, later, Jackson to the cause. In desperate need of a name to put their songs to online, they picked Anteros - the god of requited love, a landmark in London that united the scattered members in one place and, most importantly, the title of the song that cemented their retro-tinged indie pop sound.

So it’s fitting that their handle comes from a soft substance long ago used in bedding, a little-known name for the stem of the pea plant, a word chosen for its conjuring of the natural world and the warmth of sleep and—true to the enchanted quality of Haulm’s songs—Hans Christian Andersen’s The Princess and the Pea.

For the last several years, Jake McMullen gained a cult following in the folk genre, gradually mixing the traditional and experimental into something all his own. Louis Prince is both the culmination of the experiment and the start of something brand new. Influenced by 50’s and 60’s Jazz, French New Wave cinema and the stream-of-consciousness literary styles of Jack Kerouac and Joseph Conrad, Thirteen feels more like a product of the Beat Generation midcentury Greenwich Village than of Music City.  Louis Prince has crafted an album in the classic sense, with a beginning, middle, end, and a central theme. Exploring the human struggle with fear, failure and the role of friendship, Thirteen is the search for catharsis in the chaos and the pursuit of an elusive hope we glimpse in others when we find ourselves empty. “To become aware of the possibility of the search is to be onto something. Not to be onto something is to be in despair.” -Walker Percy Programming descriptions are generated by participants and do not necessarily reflect the opinions of SXSW.|30.26687979999999|-97.7397606

""What started out as a hashtag from some disgruntled audience member, ‘Sego Sucks’ ended up encapsulating the ethos behind this entire record. The more I give in to the modern temptation to generate opinions and clever commentary about everything swirling around me, the more I realize I’m not an authority on much of anything.

Founder Alex Wein (vocals, guitars), moved across the country to heed the immortal clarion call of the West Coast and wasted zero time in recruiting musicians after firmly planting his amps in the Bay Area. Looking to create an aural ash cloud of volcanic rock, Alex solidified this crew with Bay Area natives Joaquin Ridgell (drums), Jesse Serrano (guitar), and Taylor Roach (bass).  War Cloud may be a young band but they are far from wide-eyed innocents. Their musical history drenched in molten riffs across the timeline of heavy metal, the name alone originates from a Wicked Lady song of the same title. With roots encompassing everything from the modern stoner rock scene by way of classic acts ranging from Led Zeppelin to Angel Witch this is a group who love to dig deep into the beating heart of the underground. War Cloud has created a new flavor of heavy rock music for those enjoying the devilish sounds served up by the likes of Saxon, UFO, Thin Lizzy, and Pentagram. This is modern metal sophistication dipped deep in ‘70’s heavy fuzz rock.

The LP comes following a productive 2018 Summer that included performances at Psycho Las Vegas, 71Grind IV, Austin Terror Fest, Electric Funeral Fest, and more. The Munsens make noise from a Colfax Avenue dungeon, having carved out a place of their own in the much-lauded Denver metal scene over recent years. Their debut LP, Unhanded is a step in a new direction for the band, melding elements of the members’ early influences in punk, black metal, and hardcore. Offering a more complete representation of the outfit’s output from prior releases, Unhanded distinguishes the Munsens as one of the more unique and enthralling bands on the metal touring circuit.

The album brought light to the newly-formed band and earned them “Album Of The Year” honors from Metal Hammer Norway. Shortly thereafter, the band joined the Prosthetic Records roster in North America and released their critically-acclaimed sophomore album Blacklands, which led to a Canadian JUNO nomination for “Metal Album Of The Year”. Deal Thy Fate - CASTLE's fifth album - follows 2016’s Welcome To The Graveyard, which was described by Metal Hammer as “epic, heroic, tastefully melodic”. Recorded by Billy Anderson (Sleep, Neurosis), Deal Thy Fate builds on the stripped-down sound of its predecessor, pushing the envelope of classic heavy metal with epic songs that hearken back to fuzzier times while keeping the pedal down on their own hard-edged sound. Since the release of their first album, CASTLE, which consists of vocalist/bassist Elizabeth Blackwell, guitarist/vocalist Mat Davis and various touring drummers, have maintained a relentless tour schedule, performing over six-hundred shows worldwide, including their first ever tour of Japan last year.

Armed with bright white shortveralls and a rotating line-up of Sarah’s bffs, illuminati hotties has been lighting up stages across SoCal since Fall 2016 with playfully interweaving guitar lines, relentless rhythmic momentum, and strikingly self-aware vocals. Lauded as local “tenderpunk pioneers,” illuminati hotties has perfected the blend of sweetness and ferocity, of celebration and despondency, in their debut album, Kiss Yr Frenemies.   At first listen, illuminati hotties is a sun-drenched, irreverent volley with the onset of adulthood, but as the listener dives deeper, they will find an earnest consideration of musical phrasing and deliberately crafted wordplay regarding the complexity of love, loss, and skateboarding. illuminati hotties’ live show challenges audiences to bring their deepest feels and fiercest moves to the floor, and has elicited comparisons to Best Coast, Angel Olsen, Courtney Barnett, and Alvvays.

Los Angelean musician Noah Champ has one of those elusive minds: neither here nor there, but somewhere in between. His haunting and cinematic strain of mid-fi pop music, penned field trip, exposes his fascinations with memory, melancholia, emotional vacancy, and personal and social apocalypse, and he has etched these curiosities on tape for us to indulge in. After moving to New York in 2014 to study music production, Noah Champ (singer/drums) has since been joined by a rotating cast of live band members including Claire Gilb, Will Sacks, and Skyler Young. Three years of recording both at home and in the studio, and performing alongside acts such as Cloud Nothings, Homeshake, and Sunflower Bean find field trip tapping into further reaching sounds, connecting the dots between the likes of Factory Records alums, early trip hop, and space-age California.

Formed within the budding music scene of Tulsa, Oklahoma, ZUNIS built their name and following in the Tulsa music scene by curating and fronting all-ages shows around Tulsa. Where the music scene has a number of good places to play, but virtually no good all-ages venues. Thru their platform of all ages shows, backed by their philosophy of good entertainment for all ages, ZUNIS solidified themselves as major players in the local music scene by making events happen for music lovers in Tulsa. ZUNIS experienced firsthand the lack of all ages entertainment in Tulsa and pledged to change that by making shows happen. Be it a warehouse, a friends backyard, or the living room of your mom's suburban home, the show must always go on. Because (for Tulsans) the show wouldn't be happening anywhere else.

Two albums later, Amber and Graham have dialed in their sound, one that merges his obsession with world music sounds and hip hop drums with her imaginative lyrics and off-kilter pop melodies. The result is both familiar and otherworldly, a distinctive sound that has earned the duo praise from Consequence of Sound, Earmilk, and The 405, who calls CLAVVS “indie hitmakers.” Despite their often dark and hypnotic sound, there is something hopeful and human in their music. Amber and Graham are energetic and emotive, unafraid to move to their own rhythms. Perhaps that makes sense, as Amber grew up performing in musical theater and singing original Americana songs while Graham spent years on the major label side, earning 4 Grammys before walking away to find a place in the industry that felt more human.

Kelly Barnes left Los Angeles after a broken marriage resulted in a broken band. Just prior to the move, she unexpectedly hit international success, singing a monster hit called, “Get Shaky” with DJ Ian Carey. While the track and a few others were financially significant to the ex-wife and waitress, the style of music was unfulfilling to Barnes. She began to dread performing the songs and eventually became fearfully depressed. After a tragic house fire in NYC, Brian Cole opted for a fresh start. As his belongings smoldered in the winter snow, he decided to pack up what was left and head south in search of warmer days and better luck. Ironically, while most go to LA or NYC to make their dreams come true, Brian and Kelly found each other on the musician page on Craigslist in Austin, TX. While they had hoped to leave their pasts behind, inevitably, the heartbreaks found a place they call home in Darkbird.

It’s something you’ve just got to have.” 					 It’s that feel, that deep emotional intuition that fuels Cautious Clay’s sound. Blending R&B, hip-hop, and experimental indie, his productions are dark and engrossing, built upon a unique combination of organic instruments, digital programming, and soulful vocals. He writes with unflinching honesty, engaging in deeply personal self-reflection with boldly vulnerable and vividly poetic lyrics. At times recalling contemporaries like James Blake or Sampha, Cautious is a profoundly modern songwriter and a forward- thinking producer, but he’s also steeped in the past, quick to cite Burt Bacharach as an idol and credit Stevie Wonder and Quincy Jones as ever-present influences in his artful arrangements. 					 “I used to think about songwriting and production as completely separate,” he explains, “but when I learned how to merge those two things, that’s when I was able to start creating music that really connected with people.” Programming descriptions are generated by participants and do not necessarily reflect the opinions of SXSW.|30.2675715|-97.7365464

The release of their 5-track debut-EP saw them being signed by Just Isn't Music (Ninja Tune) and earned them a spot at ØYA 2018. The EP was recorded live in studio together with renowned producer Iver Sandøy (Enslaved, Wardruna), and was hailed as «... one of the finest records you'll hear this year» by Super World Indie Tunes. The band has been compared to acts such as London Grammar, The xx and Daughter, and reviewers have characterized their music as «simply spellbinding» and «beautifully haunting».

You can choose whichever you want, it’s not important for Orions Belte to be pigeonholed. They’re playing instrumental music inspired by Nigerian 70’s rock, postcards from the French Riviera, Formula One races at the Monza track in Italy, and when Joe Frazier beat Muhammad Ali in the ‘Fight of the Century’ in 1971. Eclectic and unique. Øyvind Blomstrøm and Chris Holm mainly make a living out of being on the road with other bands, and they’re almost always traveling from town to town, country to country. When their roads crossed for the umpteenth time in 2016, their mutual dream of starting an instrumental project was finally underway. Holm’s companion from the Bergen scene, Kim Åge Furuhaug, wanted to join in on the fun, and then Orions Belte was born.  Their debut album «Mint» is founded on old traditions but still feels new, and you’ll have to look for a long time to find anything like it. Texas band Khruangbin may be the best comparison as per today, but Orions Belte really belongs in their own galaxy. A galaxy where they are the soundtrack to movies that haven’t been made yet.

After forming as a duo unit in 2013, the group mainly focused on performing live. Despite being unknown, they were selected as the opening act for the American Indie band, DEERHOOF, and quickly became locally recognized for their talent. In fact, the name, “the perfect me” was taken from one of DEERHOOF’s songs. The group’s first album, “INTO THE HOUSE”, was released in 2017. Their music blends various styles such as black music, indie rock and jazz, and has gained the support from sophisticated music listeners. Nishimura also shares his talent as a recording engineer for local artists. He has showcased his talent on fellow newcomer artist, STEPHENSMITH’s 2016 album, “sexperiment” as a recording/mixing engineer.  After gutarist, massiveeffect, left the group in July, 2018, the perfect me officially restarted as a solo unit.

The album was instantly embraced by San Francisco college radio station KUSF where it went into heavy rotation. Tours across the world and internationally released records ensued, Compelling and captivating, eX-Girl can easily be ranked along side musical innovators such as Zappa, B-52’s, Nina Hagen, Devo, and Talking Heads.

Bolstered by recent tours with The Jesus And Mary Chain, INVSN and The Pains Of Being Pure At Heart, on “Empty Sea” Laura Carbone delves deeper into the intoxicating mix of dark reverb-laden pop melodies, searing rock riffs and noisy feedback chaos hinted at on her debut album “Sirens”. Written partly in the gray claustrophobia of the German winter and finished in the vast golden expanse of the California desert and the gritty glare of L.A., “Empty Sea” boldly oozes the confidence and swagger of a survivor. Laura Carbone moves effortlessly here from sexy tribal stomp to delicate beauty, Brecht-ian mystique and beyond. Prepare to be charmed and disarmed, battered and bruised, to ultimately emerge from the depths of the “Empty Sea” grasping desperately for the “REPEAT” button. Berlin-based Laura Carbone’s latest single, “The Flowers Beneath Your Feet”, saw her joining forces to duet with Kip Berman of NY’s The Pains Of Being Pure At Heart on this sparkling, noisy dream pop diamond-in-the-rough.

With its combination of reverb-drenched guitars, synth bass lines, commanding vocals, and rhythmic drum machine beats, this project is a stark departure from Clinco’s previous stints as drummer in Marriages and Black Mare. Dubbed “Tragic Wave” and “Mid-Fi” by DeMure, Drab Majesty eloquently blends classic 80s New Wave and hints of early 4AD with a futuristic originality. Drab Majesty’s first release, a limited-edition cassette of 100 copies titled Unarian Dances, was self-released in 2012 and re-pressed by Lolipop Records shortly thereafter. Drab Majesty then signed with Dais Records and put out the debut LP Careless in 2015. Careless was met with high praise from critics and fans alike, and the original pressing is now a sought-after gem. A year after the initial pressings of Careless sold out, Dais released a compilation titled Completely Careless, featuring Drab Majesty’s entire discography, including two previously unreleased tracks.

This idea has always been in the band’s DNA, from its three members -- each with their own distinct and essential contributions -- to the flurry of interlocking notes and melodies that make up their intricate songs. Now on their self-titled sophomore album, it also extends into their worldview, as Honey and Salt seek to cut through the pessimistic fog of seemingly inescapable sociopolitical unease, and highlight the vital capability of the individual. Where many bands look for commonality amongst its members’ tastes, Honey and Salt revel in their differences, seamlessly blending their disparate influences into a sound that manages to be complex without sacrificing immediacy. The self-titled album deftly utilizes everything from Kinsella-esque guitar lines, to post-rock dynamics, to hardcore ferocity — all while packing an emotional resonance straight out of DC’s Revolution Summer — and finds the band completely comfortable with balancing their intricacies.

With members hailing from Austin, Texas and Auckland, New Zealand, and a musical pedigree that includes bands such as My Education, Lost Rockets, Body Corporate and Deathbeam, Swallow the Rat offers a unique mix of NZ Post-punk and Texan Psychedelia.  Forming in late 2017, Swallow the Rat wasted no time, immediately recording a number of songs with acclaimed engineer Nick Abbott at Auckland's Northwestern Recorders, all of which charted on New Zealand's Alt Charts and Student Radio, along with receiving air play on KOOP (Austin, TX) and DKFM (CAN). In mid 2018, they embarked on their first New Zealand tour, and in late 2018 they will return to the studio with Abbott to complete a full album.

Having met each other in high school after bonding over similar music tastes and vintage clothing, The Pantones first formed under the name ""Bande à part"" (which translates to Band Of Outsiders in French) after a 1964 Jean-Luc Godard film. When contacted, however, by a venue to perform in an upcoming show, The Pantones immediately rebranded and recorded two singles by themselves. The band records their instruments in a bedroom while vocals in their high school's ROP room. After the release of the two singles, comparisons to the jangly guitar riffs of The Smiths were quickly made. In November of 2017, the group released the EP ""For The Ones Who Love You."" After being inspired by the 1981 single ""Primary"" by The Cure (where Gallup and Smith were both playing bass), two bass guitars became a prominent feature of the EP. After being inspired by self-produced acts in the 1980s (The Cleaners From Venus, The Hit Parade, etc.), The Pantones decided to self-record and release two new singles in September of 2018.

While technically a “dark punk” band, they cast a wider net to capture their musical and ideological influences than the majority of other darkwave and deathrock acts that have cropped up in recent years. Their creative process is a fluid amalgam of influences spanning from The Symbolists, The Viennese Actionists, what the band describes as “Romantic Essentialism”, and various proto- and post- punk artists from within and outside the main currents of their genres. It’s no small miracle that Terminal A manage to leverage this heady creative bedrock and still deliver emotionally penetrative jams that aim for the gut and the groin, that are still undeniably rock and roll in nature."" - Arjun Rey, Sovo Mag Programming descriptions are generated by participants and do not necessarily reflect the opinions of SXSW."|30.2670461|-97.7362776

In the case of the Winnipeg-born, Brooklyn-based musician Devon Church, it took the dissolution of a decade-long marriage and creative collaboration (Exitmusic, a nightmare-pop project co-founded by Church's ex-wife) to send him down the road of discovering his own singular, rough-hewn-yet-elegant style.  Church applies his experience as a producer, multi-instrumentalist and songwriter to an equally absorbing solo project—one that plunges his Cohen-esque pop poetics into an ocean of drone, psychedelic minimalism, harmonic noise, and distortion-tinged, angelic ambience. Sensuous, surrealist lyrics—touching on themes of romantic obsession, religious ambivalence, dysfunctional families, and the ineffable strangeness of human existence—are delivered in a ravaged, soulful baritone, approximating some chimeric offspring of two-cigarettes-at-once Tom Waits, a tripped-out David Bowie, and John Maus.  The result is a well-crafted exploration of samsara and nirvana, heaven and earth, two states seemingly coexisting in the songs themselves. It's an entrancing listen.

With a background in graphic design, Fribourg imbues his work with a sense of architectural composition, layering angular guitar riffs and analog synths over throbbing drums and driving bass.  Fribourg developed his love affair with synthesizers -- and his open-minded approach to music -- as a founding member of LA psych-kraut favorites Froth. However, it was only with the creation of Numb.er that he was able to fully explore his eclectic musical inclinations. Combining elements of punk, shoegaze and post-punk, the project never commits to a singular worldview, allowing Fribourg’s vision to go anywhere without sounding ironic or forced. With the release of Goodbye, the band’s first LP, Numb.er offers a genre-defying sonic document that finds them maximizing the creative potential of the studio while always remaining true to their dynamic and arresting live sound. Mixed and mastered by Mikey Young of Total Control, Goodbye is a tightly crafted debut from one of Los Angeles’ most exciting new bands.

FOLLOWING 2016'S FOREBODING POST PLAGUE, NO POP IS THE BAND'S STARKER, MORE DANCE-FLOOR-FRIENDLY FOURTH LP. EXECUTED WITH PRECISION, EVERY SONIC COMPONENT OF NO POP COMMANDS ATTENTION. STRIPPING DOWN INSTRUMENTATION TO A HANDFUL OF SYNTHS AND AN ELECTRONIC DRUM KIT, THE BAND WORKED QUICKLY TO WRITE AND RECORD, BRINGING DEMOS AND IMPROVISED TAKES INTO THE STUDIO AND COMPLETING THE RECORDING PROCESS OVER THE COURSE OF THREE DAYS. THE RESULT IS A FOCUSED BLEND OF HARD-HITTING INDUSTRIAL, TECHNO, AND NOISE – BUT EACH TRACK ON NO POP IS NEVER JUST ONE OF THOSE ELEMENTS.

Originally formed in 1980, The Chills had a revolving cast of band members with Phillipps remaining the only constant. His knack for writing fantastic pop songs led to chart hits back home and a cult following around the world.  With early releases via the legendary NZ label Flying Nun, The Chills produced a number of critically acclaimed recordings such as the single “Pink Frost” (their first hit) from the compilation album Kaleidoscope World and “Wet Blanket” from the LP Brave Words.  Joining influential labels Creation and Homestead, they then moved to Warner Brothers imprint Slash and onto the world of majors. The BBC's John Peel invited them in for a number of BBC sessions (1985/1987/1988) which were released for the first time 2017. The Chills live energy is the central reason why The Chills are remembered fondly in all of the 39 countries that they have thus far visited. It’s the combination of this AND the consistent quality of their songs which have established The Chills as one of the most well-known New Zealand groups to date - particularly in the US, UK and Europe.

3221|Mar 15, 2019|611 E 7th St. Austin, TX, EUA|*repeat repeat|10:25pm|9:45pm|Barracuda Backyard|*repeat repeat was founded by Jared Corder — a former punk-rock kid raised on the sounds of Bad Religion & Black Flag. The goal was simple: to make edgy, guitar-driven music that nodded to the classic sounds of Jared's California birthplace, complete with hazy harmonies and surf-inspired arrangements. The problem? The group needed a female harmony singer, and nobody seemed to fit the bill. Things changed when the band's producer suggested that Jared's wife, Kristyn, sing with the band. The fit was natural. Kristyn had grown up in California, listening to '60s legends like the Mamas and the Papas & The Everly Brothers. She quickly completed the band, sharing vocal duties with Jared and serving as the inspiration for much of Bad Latitude — a debut album largely written by Jared during the couple's engagement. Floral Canyon (their sophomore album) stretches the band's musical envelope, adding depth, drive, and darkness to the sun-baked, surf-tinged pop that's always been their bedrock. Gluing everything together is the band's melodic, musical attack: equal parts percussive thunder, trembling organ, synth pads, coed harmonies, and wide-ranging guitar parts.

Over the period of a couple years, they wrote-recorded-practiced and performed themselves into the ground, releasing 5.5 singles, an EP and an album. They’ve played literally hundreds of local shows as well as 60-some national dates with the likes of Twin Peaks, Bleached, Together PANGEA and The Whigs, among others.  With the current, often bewildering, state of the music business, it’s impossible to say how an album like Run It Again will be received. Fortunately, because of the autonomy of the internet, business machinations and hurdles no longer rule the masses. The quality of Criminal Hygiene’s writing and performances is sure to be recognized by the portion of the global music community who listen carefully, however large or small that may be.

The question rattles across the second LP from Washington, D.C. rock iconoclasts Priests: The Seduction of Kansas. Seduction evokes pleasure, sex—but it can become propaganda, a tactic of manipulation, a ploy in the politics of persuasion. “There’s something sinister about the idea of seducing a whole state,” says drummer Daniele Daniele. “You’re clearly up to something. Why would you do it?” The title—like Priests—is a moving target, probing questions about the realities and mythologies of America in 2019 without prescribing easy answers. Daniele, vocalist Katie Alice Greer, and guitarist G.L. Jaguar—remain an inspired anomaly in modern music. A band on its own label, Sister Polygon Records- Priests play rock’n’roll that is as intellectually sharp as it is focused on pop’s thrilling pleasure centers, that is topical without sloganeering. The high-wire physicality of their live shows, the boldness of their Barbara Kruger-invoking visual statements, their commitment to cultural, political, and aesthetic critique—it’s all made Priests one of the most exciting bands of their generation, subversive in a literal sense, doing things you would not expect.

After a brief hiatus, during which time Bradford Cox and Lockett Pundt released their own albums as Atlas Sound and Lotus Plaza respectively, a new Deerhunter line-up (with additions of bassist Josh Mckay and guitarist Frankie Broyles) reconvened in January 2013 at Rare Book Studio in Brooklyn, New York. Produced by Nicholas Vernhes and Bradford Cox and recorded in the dead of night, Deerhunter's new longplayer Monomania will be released in May.

He works in National Parks, cutting trails through the woods, probably wearing a vest or a funny hat and crapping in holes in the ground. He goes weeks on end without seeing another single person. When he does finally wander into town, he usually comes back with a pack-mule-donkey-satchel-thing chock full of songs about women that he’s been dreaming of, places where he used to be happy, situations he screwed up… really dipping into a well of memories that are probably better left alone. …you hear the songs and you’ll be won over immediately. You watch him play and you’ll wish he’d never stop. You talk to him for a minute and you’ll offer up your prettiest daughter and welcome him into your family. But if you turn your back on him for even a minute, he’ll probably wander back up the mountain and give up whatever you offer him, no matter how sweet the sitch or pretty the daughter. He’s got his own agenda and it’s frustrating but also so admirable. My advice is to catch him whenever and however you can and celebrate this sensitive mountain man while he’s around.  ~Jonny Fritz Programming descriptions are generated by participants and do not necessarily reflect the opinions of SXSW.|30.2701568|-97.7360368

Playing cleanly articulated lines that perhaps recall some of great guitar tandems of yore–Allman/Betts, Jansch/Renbourn– while “summoning the Dead for Pavement fans”, Garcia Peoples epitomize ‘post-jam’ in its proper arrival point; borrowing all the best of what’s preceded them without regarding boundaries, a bounce all their own, and a characteristically delightful lack of polish to keep things grounded.

The sisters, who record under the moniker Lily & Madeleine, boldly explore what it means to be women in the 21st century, and aren't afraid to use their music to call out injustices or double standards. This fearless approach has permeated their three albums, which are full of insightful lyrics and thoughtful indie-pop. But with their fourth studio album, Canterbury Girls (New West) — named after Canterbury Park, located in their hometown of Indianapolis, Indiana—the sisters are coming into their own as women and musicians. ""This is the first record Lily and I have ever done where we have full control over all of the songwriting,"" says Madeleine. ""We did co-write with some people that we really love. But everything on this record is completely ours. I feel like I have full ownership over it, and that makes me feel very strong and independent.""

Look Together tackles themes of repairing relationships, shedding insecurities, and fresh starts, with vibrant guitar/synth lines layered under Gutierrez’s pop melodies. The impassioned 12-track LP began to form merely a week after the release of 2014’s 88 92, as Gutierrez and Swann’s decade-long romantic relationship dissolved. Healing proved to be difficult, as Wild Moccasins were charted for two years of extensive touring. Gutierrez and Swann would spend countless hours in a shared van, painfully staring each other down on stage and exchanging exaggerated he- said-she-said’s through songwriting. Gutierrez and Swann began their writing partnership roughly a year into their romantic relationship, in 2007. The group has undergone roster changes over the years, but currently exists with the addition of Avery Davis (drums). Their latest effort is highly pop-powered, with Ben H. Allen (Gnarls Barkley, Deerhunter, Animal Collective) at the production helm.

Which left Gispert, who had spent the majority of his adult life either in the studio or on the road with the band, at a crossroads.  “It occurred to me that if I wanted to record and tour that I was going to need to do it solo,” the singer, songwriter and guitarist says. “I'd always thought about it in the back of my mind as something that I wanted to do one day, but ‘one day’ had never really come.”  Now, ‘one day’ is here in the form of Sunlight Tonight , Gispert’s debut solo album (produced and mixed by Emery Dobyns).

Previously an in-demand backing group for the countrified likes of Kris Kristofferson and Leon Bridges, The Texas Gentlemen mix Americana, jazz, surfy harmonies, blues, rock’n’roll and a bunch of other stuff into infectious nuggets and jams. All of which came to light - in surprisingly magnificent style - at this midweek show.  We like the Gentlemen’s debut album, TX Jelly, but this gig was a whole other level of musical mastery. Without saying a great deal, and with any established ‘hits’ in their repertoire, they conveyed the full weight of their collective talents with effortless class and charisma. They didn’t even play our personal favorites, and we still came away thinking it was the best thing we’d seen all year - and one of the best gigs we’d been to… well, ever.  But maybe that’s what you get with a team of shit-hot session players who click like this; a colorful, boundaries-be-damned but super tight fusion, built on first-class tunes. And best of all, they made it look so damn fun and easy.  -Polly Glass Programming descriptions are generated by participants and do not necessarily reflect the opinions of SXSW.|30.2701568|-97.7360368

They’re probably wearing the same clothes they had on yesterday, and reminiscing about last night’s gig. Inspired by a guitar lick that cuts to the bone or a melody that lingers on refrain, this band is following a path forged by countless other musicians who’ve lived and died in dive bars or ‘made it’ with their posters taped to bedroom walls. What makes this band of brothers any different? This band is The Artisanals.  When Johnny Delaware moved from small town South Dakota to Charleston, SC he met Clay Houle and bassist Eric Mixon to form The Artisanals in late 2016. Now, with drummer Nick Recio, and keyboardist Ian Klin rounding out the group, The Artisanals have dropped the first ever record to come out of the Magic Barn - an Iowa studio-converted-barn that features the Neve console and gear from NYC's now defunct Magic Shop Studio. Utilizing everything from gong, organ, piano, sitar, french horn, trombone, and koto, to a string section sourced from a nearby University, every song on 'The Artisanals' (Sept 2018) self-titled LP is a straight banger.

Kendrix explains in Me Right Now’s liner notes that the work is “an open window into my life” the product of a stressful move and the struggles of dealing with “the insecurities of a relationship and fatherhood, of following my dreams while juggling real life.” The EP’s predecessor Worth Something hinted at those insecurities as well, and paved the way for Kendrix to abandon hip hop braggadocio for self-loathing R&B but Me Right Now and Kendrix’s rebranding make it something more permanent and evocative. Kendrix makes this change apparent not just in the more melodic vocal approach but in the claustrophobic emotional intensity of every facet of the production, from the raw, blunt lyrics to the hurt and wounded feeling of the music itself. The aptly named “Pain” hits with the density of a throbbing toothache, Kendrix’s voice quavering over seismic bass and gasping samples.” - Nick Hanover (Ovrld)  Programming descriptions are generated by participants and do not necessarily reflect the opinions of SXSW.|30.2701568|-97.7360368

They were named by i-D, as well as Dazed and Confused magazine, as one of the top 5 bands from East Asia to watch out for.

Born to a working-class blue-collar family, Chris struggled to find the middle ground between his grandfather’s Southern Baptist sermons and the honky-tonk mystics that he discovered on old vinyl records in high school. Armed with an old thrift-shop guitar, Chris began playing and writing stories about life from a unique but oddly familiar point-of-view. Songs about liquor stores, truck stops, low-rent motels, and the grifters and transients that frequent them. It doesn’t matter if it’s a pool hall or a theater, a festival or a front porch, Chris’s live sound is the whiskey-laden prospectus that anyone with a struggle can relate to.

Maybe it's all those times he watched his dad leave the house so full of purpose, so clearly identified as a working man. It’s an unassuming look for a power pop extraordinaire.  Praise has piled up over the years. The Austin Chronicle tossed around phrases like “perfect summer album” and “rock-solid barroom pop salvation” to describe his work with Moonlight Towers, the band he founded in 2001. Little Steven Van Zandt named their song Heat Lightning the coveted title of “Coolest Song in the World” on his radio show, Underground Garage. Heavy airplay followed, and even legendary producer and Rolling Stones manager Andrew Loog Oldham called the song one of his “tops of the year.”  Stevens shrugs off the accolades and the criticism with equal aplomb. “I’m just tryin to make cool shit"" he says, with a serious expression, and what truly could be more profound than that? (Following the whims of his artistic vision remains his only prerogative.)  Although newly minted as a solo performer, Stevens has already devoted a lifetime to music, and the proof is abundant.

Playing an abundance of shows – at small clubs, squats and festivals such as The Great Escape, Lowlands, c/o pop, Plissken and Reeperbahn – has whipped Iguana into even more ferocious live band, and that experience carries over in the recordings. Like The Clash and Minutemen before them, Iguana Death Cult have embraced the art of rocking the fuck out with all senses and impulses up to eleven. Rapturously sinking in their claws, and never letting go. Programming descriptions are generated by participants and do not necessarily reflect the opinions of SXSW.|30.2663066|-97.73586309999999

She's one of a handful of artists to wow audiences as intimate as Nashville's famed Bluebird Cafe and as grand as Amsterdam's 18.000 seat Ziggo Dome. She keeps it real and humble, focused on making her music as authentic as she is.  Her second album, ""Morning Sun"", was recorded by Chris Taylor (Elle King, The Wood Brothers) at Southern Ground Studios (Emmylou Harris, Kris Kristofferson, Willie Nelson), and appeared in Sep 2018 via V2/Munich Records.

San Mei is enamored with the transportative nature of music, her guitar heavy, delay ridden, dreamy pop explores the hyper-blaze of existence and the intricacies of the in between. Family and home have always been integral to Hamilton’s creative process. The daughter of Chinese-Malaysian and New Zealand born parents, her family immigrated to Australia at an early age.  Her parents, resilient and sacrificial, nurtured and encouraged her creatively, instilling in her a gift that she would lean on heavily to help diffuse and navigate the chaos of growing up and forging her identity. Using art as therapy, her songs became a conduit for escape and to shoulder the loss of her mother.  Armed with just a MIDI-keyboard and a Macbook San Mei was born. Her DIY project quickly gained groundswell and nods from national tastemakers Triple J, and further afield from heavy weights NME and NYLON.

They are comprised of Star Kendrick (vocals) and Toma Banjanin (guitar/vocals) - two childhood friends from Australia's Sunshine Coast. But the duo can be divided in more ways than just their physical existence, too, from geographical location and what they bring to the band, to their musical histories.  It's the perfect mix of blissed out, beach-y pop - the aural equivalent of driving along the coast on a heavenly summer's day - and melancholy, heartbroken lyrics. Toma spearheads the musical side, while Star largely writes the lyrics, filling them with stories of her life. The title itself encapsulates that polarity, as well as the idea of Star's constant coming-and-going, flying across the great big blue of one ocean or another each time.

Africa is everywhere in Brazil, and it pulses through the music on Quebra Cabeça (Puzzle), Bixiga 70’s second studio album for Glitterbeat, where two continents dance together across the black Atlantic. The result still captures the incendiary excitement of Bixiga 70 live, but the freedom of the studio brings more shade and subtlety than before. The rhythms are more sinuous than ever, snaking through the funk in way that looks more to Ghana or Nigeria than Memphis or Muscle Shoals, while the horns strut in powerful harmonies. It’s music that forges connections and retraces history while sounding absolutely contemporary. But for Bixiga 70, African will always be the root, and Brazil its beautiful, vibrant flower.

After years of performing poetry and singing in experimental projects, Tim took to the bedroom with the sole intention of making a tape for his best friend in the grips of a long battle with depression. The result feels like an adolescent, whose broken into the Pentagon just to piss on the carpet and fulfill a uniform fetish with his father’s colleagues. It is the collision...ahem collusion... of these dual energies which has ultimately expanded the project into a five piece jazz punk ensemble. At times the band sounds like the Talking Heads fronted by a murderous queer Black Francis. In other moments it sounds like Ian Curtis convinced that he sounds like Dionne Warwick; a crooning epileptic in a balladeer's ballgown. In a more general sense, the members of Blood have been brought together by a mutual instinct to curate a perverse love affair between noise and pop music. Regardless of how much vitriol the band has allowed to seep from the stage, one can at all times feel a greater sense of militant naivety which guides the bands every move. -Steve Job 4:20 Programming descriptions are generated by participants and do not necessarily reflect the opinions of SXSW.|30.26828699999999|-97.73675999999999

Multi-instrumentalists Juli Keller and Cody Dosier started playing music together in 2016, but Being Dead didn’t take its true form until the following year, when they decided to stake out a 2-person operation. Keller and Dosier share instrument duties, swapping between vox, keys, guitar, and percussion, the end result a lo-fi creep-rock experimentation at the intersection of brash and melodic.

They’re playing instrumental music inspired by Nigerian 70’s rock, postcards from the French Riviera, Formula One races at the Monza track in Italy, and when Joe Frazier beat Muhammad Ali in the ‘Fight of the Century’ in 1971. Eclectic and unique. Øyvind Blomstrøm and Chris Holm mainly make a living out of being on the road with other bands, and they’re almost always traveling from town to town, country to country. When their roads crossed for the umpteenth time in 2016, their mutual dream of starting an instrumental project was finally underway. Holm’s companion from the Bergen scene, Kim Åge Furuhaug, wanted to join in on the fun, and then Orions Belte was born.  Their debut album «Mint» is founded on old traditions but still feels new, and you’ll have to look for a long time to find anything like it. Texas band Khruangbin may be the best comparison as per today, but Orions Belte really belongs in their own galaxy. A galaxy where they are the soundtrack to movies that haven’t been made yet.

In performance, vocalist/synthethist/percussionist Billy Brat will flail around the room, brandishing his iconic serpent-like facial expression -- tongue out, eyes rolled into the back of his head. Terry Turtle dawns his signature mask and chain mail, his acoustic guitar hangs low around his neck and is adorned with a hallucinatory painted finish; he's a stoic figure while Billy thrashes about the stage. Musically, Buck Gooter's sound is filled with manic howls, melodic synth sequences, crisp and pummeling drum machines, and highly distorted guitar, resulting in a cacophonous punk-industrial haze a la Nine Inch Nails, Iggy Pop and Grinderman.

The album, out via Northern Light (CA) and CMM (US),  sold out in 3 months, leading to a reprint on US label Neon Sigh (Telescopes, Ringo Deathstarr).  Their live set at Manchester's Cosmosis Festival, headlined by The Jesus & Mary Chain, Brian Jonestown Massacre and WIRE, kickstarted a 44 date tour touching UK, France, Belgium, Austria, Switzerland and Italy, during which the band shared the stage with The Telescopes, Ringo Deathstarr and Gonjasufi.

Largely comprising songs from their original D.I.Y. efforts, their second EP, “Coma Happy”, appeared in 2016. Fangclub made their U.K. live debut in 2016 with Welsh group Pretty Vicious, and toured with Twin Atlantic. The album was released in 2017 with Vertigo & Virgin EMI Records to glowing reviews with the band themselves calling it “A love letter to our favourite bands"".

Any band that so much as uses an effect pedal or feedback has one or the other slapped onto their description.This is unfortunate, because every so often a real, tried and true, dreamy, noisy, poppy, shoegaze band emerges. Fortunately for us, such a band has taken form and materialized from none other than Cincinnati, Ohio. This band is Smut. Smut is noise pop for the people. Marrying all of the good parts of all of the good genres the band has mastered their craft. Guitarists Andrew Min and Sam Ruschman bring tastefully fuzzed out and distorted riffs to the table; held up by the unmistakably solid rhythmic framework laid down by bassist Bell Cenower and drummer Harold Bon; and at the forefront of it all, is vocalist Tay Roebuck. At times commanding and peremptory, there are other moments where the power of her voice is matched by the rest of the band. Within that control is a distinct effortlessness and this sets her apart while simultaneously fashioning the band’s purist shoegaze identity.

3394|Mar 12, 2019|900 Red River St. Austin, TX, EUA|Passeport|8:25pm|7:45pm|Cheer Up Charlie's|Passeport is a collaborative ElectroPop trio comprised of three writer/producer/performers from Cincinnati, Ohio. Like many groups before them, Brian Davis (synth, producer), Mia Carruthers (vocalist, writer) and Benjamin Hines (writer, guitarist) met in playing in a different band in 2014. When that band fizzled out in 2016, they remained close friends and began to collaborate on songs from the ground up, a process they had never explored in their previous, more traditional group. The combination of their diverse musical backgrounds and sensibilities allowed them each to be challenged in new ways, as they wrote, produced and recorded together resulting an exciting and empowering collection of songs.  The group made its debut with “On the Run,” a collaboration and feature performance with L.A. Electronic/Dance producer/DJ/artist NGHTMRE from his latest EP for Mad Decent, the label founded by Diplo. In 2019, they will release a series of singles leading to their debut EP released by Modern Outsider.

The Austin-based ten-piece collective of musicians known as Hard Proof began by studying the blueprint of Fela Kuti’s Africa 70 band, as well as funk and jazz from the whole of sub-Saharan Africa. Founded in 2008, Hard Proof features members of Black Joe Lewis and the Honeybears, Black Pumas, Cougar, Spoon, the Echocentrics, and several other notable Austin acts. In 2013, Hard Proof released their first vinyl, collaborating with Canada's Kept Records for the Dragon/Tere 45 that they tracked with Adrian Quesada of Grupo Fantasma and Brownout. In 2014 Hard Proof released a Cassette Store Day cassingle, and played the Austin City Limits festival after a successful East coast run. In 2016 the band released a 100% analog 45rpm LP produced by Jim Eno (Spoon) at his own studio for his Public Hi-Fi imprint. Hard Proof’s most recent full length came out in January of 2017 on Modern Outsider Records featuring production from Chris “Frenchie” Smith.

Aries' music is densely melodic, like echoes of the west coast in the 1960s coming through the Spanish radio waves. Amidst all the synthesizers, drum machines, buzzes and whirrs, the most prominent, playful, melancholy, important piece pasting everything together is Isabel's voice, light and dancing in circles around every song. Her album ""Adieu or Die"" released by K Records is the first record sung in Spanish under Calvin Johnson's seminal label and a unique excursion into electronic: pop full of shiny harmonies, explosive beats and shimmering sounds.

Their new LP ‘Other Nature’ brings to life a personal collection of songs written by guitarist / vocalist Lauren Larson after the birth of her daughter. The result is an exhilarating expression of courage, defiance, and love — the band’s most emotionally raw and beautifully triumphant record yet. The story of Ume begins with Lauren falling in love with not turning down as a 15 yr old guitarist in a noise punk band. Dedicated to performing like her life depended on it, Lauren’s music career took her from DIY shows, to Ume playing major festivals like ACL and Paris' Rock En Seine and appearing on Anthony Bourdain’s No Reservations.  After taking a break to start a family, Lauren and bassist Eric Larson teamed with powerhouse drummer Aaron Perez and Grammy-winning engineer Stuart Sikes (Loretta Lynn, Cat Power) to reawaken the band. The acclaimed and triumphant result 'Other Nature' was released on Modern Outsider in 2018.

Bridging the gap between diary rock and synth pop, Warm Human uses fuzzy drones, ambient textures and pressurized 808's to accentuate the desperation of being a living breathing person. Her mixtape, Worm Human, is streamable on all things streaming, and her debut LP, Ghastly will be released early 2019. “Her upcoming album, Ghastly, tells deeply personal stories through a melange of synths, vocal processing and brilliant pop arrangements. As a producer, composer and lyricist, Meredith infuses feeling into each bit of the albums DNA. She tells her side of the story with a balance of ferocity and compassion, that is at times both uniquely funny and absolutely heartbreaking.

""I also wanted to make a record that made people dance...so, here ya go."" Now on his third full-length release, the Austin, TX-based songwriter has become well known for embracing contradiction, ""blending genres and techniques"" (Billboard) into a sound that's hard to pin down. NPR's All Songs Considered described him as a ""rhythmic sound effect master"" who creates ""curious, textured music,"" while World Cafe called it ""wonderfully inventive."" ""I’ve never wanted to be one of those songwriters who compartmentalizes what part of their lives comes out in their songs,"" he says. ""I wanted to deal with Trump, and Charlottesville, and the 'Me Too' movement alongside things like breaking up and falling in love.""

It all began in Brooklyn, where songwriter Leslie Sisson lived for nearly a decade while playing in a number of touring bands. She came back to her home state of Texas to be near her family while navigating through a series of life-changing events. This led to an array of songs that shaped the birth of the band. The debut LP 'One' released via Modern Outsider Records in 2015 conjured a wave of dream gaze and international acclaim. Moving Panoramas break the shell of 'One' veritably 'In Two' with the new sophomore LP available via Modern Outsider 2/22/19, expanding room for more diversity, rhythm, volume, instrumentation such as the swimmy pedal steel, plus special guests Matthew Caws of Nada Surf & Sabrina Ellis of A Giant Dog/Sweet Spirit. Over the years, the band's lineup featured a moving cast of magical busy talent but has luckily landed on the incredibly solid current Baby Blues crew with Cara Tillman, Rosie Castoe, Jordan Rivell, Jody Suarez, & Phil McJunkins.Programming descriptions are generated by participants and do not necessarily reflect the opinions of SXSW.|30.26960979999999|-97.73635829999999

Following well-anticipated showcases at SXSW in 2018, they released sophomore album ‘Where We Were Together’ and a Record Store Day special covers EP ‘It’s Just A Short Walk!’. Their blend of indie rock, dream pop and surf has been widely met with critical acclaim from the likes of Pitchfork, The Fader, Stereogum, NPR, KEXP, i-D, Dazed, ELLE and more.

A mainstay on the festival circuit, The Bright Light Social Hour has played Lollapalooza, Austin City Limits, Hangout Festival and Sasquatch! Festival among others.  Not ones to shy away from politics, the band has also built a reputation for their musical responses to current social issues, like ""Tear Down That Wall,"" produced by Jim Eno (Spoon) and released on the day of President Donald Trump's inauguration.

Having formed the band while still in high school, the members first met at a time when each were independently serving as the “token girl” in various dude-bands from their hometown of Cincinnati, OH. Coming from varied musical backgrounds (ranging from garage-rock, to surf, to opera), the distinct talents and influences of each member collided in unexpected ways at the band’s first rehearsal. It was here the band discovered that their chemistry wasn’t rooted in a shared musical reference point, but in the creative relief from the expected censorship of being a sideperson. ​Produced by Yoni Wolf (WHY?), the new album Almost glides between palatial assuredness and pallid introspection, looking back on youthful yearning—the uncertainties, the traumas, the anxieties—without discounting its soft beauty.  The Ophelias steer Almost through the lineage of coming-of-age confessionals, and affectionately document their growth into a warm, fractured adulthood. ​ Programming descriptions are generated by participants and do not necessarily reflect the opinions of SXSW.|30.26960979999999|-97.73635829999999

A year later, he reemerged with Baby FuzZ, a bizarre alt rock/glam pop band with a rotating cast of contributors and members. Baby FuzZ's music fuses a number of styles from emo to rock and roll to creepy pitch shifted ballads. Described as “one of the most slept on acts in music” by Hillydilly, Baby FuzZ released a litany of brilliant singles in 2018 and drops a debut album Plastic Paradise on February 26. Baby FuzZ has also made a name as an enigmatic video artist, constructing some golden era MTV style music videos. Drawing comparisons to everyone from Billy Corgan to Elton John and Elliot Smith, it's hard to pin down exactly how to classify BF. In the past, Fox, the frontman of Baby FuzZ, produced “Video Games” by Lana Del Rey and has written for the likes of Madonna, Britney Spears, and Avicii, so there is a decidedly surreal pop sensibility to the weirdness. But with a charmingly punk ethos and a unique self produced album, Baby FuzZ just might be the strange new arrival the alt rock world needs.

It’s something you’ve just got to have.” 					 It’s that feel, that deep emotional intuition that fuels Cautious Clay’s sound.

He writes with unflinching honesty, engaging in deeply personal self-reflection with boldly vulnerable and vividly poetic lyrics. At times recalling contemporaries like James Blake or Sampha, Cautious is a profoundly modern songwriter and a forward- thinking producer, but he’s also steeped in the past, quick to cite Burt Bacharach as an idol and credit Stevie Wonder and Quincy Jones as ever-present influences in his artful arrangements. 					 “I used to think about songwriting and production as completely separate,” he explains, “but when I learned how to merge those two things, that’s when I was able to start creating music that really connected with people.” Programming descriptions are generated by participants and do not necessarily reflect the opinions of SXSW.|30.26960979999999|-97.73635829999999

My music and my identity come from the same foundation of being a Native woman.” Katherine Paul is Black Belt Eagle Scout, and after releasing an EP in 2014 Paul has wrapped up the band’s first full-length. Recorded in the middle of winter near her hometown in Northwest Washington, the landscape’s eerie beauty and Paul’s connection to it are palpable on Mother of My Children. Stemming from this place, the album traces the full spectrum of confronting buried feelings and the loss of what life was supposed to look like. Mother of My Children is a life chapter gently preserved, and the access listeners have to such vulnerability feels special and generous. We are left wanting more, and all signs point to Black Belt Eagle Scout just getting started.

Highway Hypnosis, her forthcoming album on Merge Records that will drop in January, plays on hip-hop, post-punk, and invented words to fill a gap between the feminist underground and genre-specific singles charts. Through it, Moolchan joins the resistance forged by queer black feminists who create, explore, empower, conquer, and play bass. The solo act, born with Pluto in Scorpio, released her first single “Beliefs” in September. The glimmering anthem shrouded in an atmosphere of darkness drops its beat along with a call to arms for all non-believers whose mantra is assigned: “Remove your beliefs and start again / ’cause all I wanna do is start again.”  Flashes of Robyn, Britney Spears, Jock Jams, Nirvana, recess hour on the blacktop, M.I.A., Lil Mama, a hacky sack circle, Aaliyah, and your first Warped Tour experience somehow all make sense inside the mind attached to ears experiencing Highway Hypnosis.

Her music is a genre-blending of energetic compositions, jazz influenced experimentalism, pop-infused melodies, abstract beats, synthetic textures, squeezed and deformed noises, rampaging drums and infinite layers of vivid imaginary sounds, with which she builds up coloured artificial places to sense unpredictable emotions. RRUCCULLA's talent proves even more when the unparalleled artist delivers on acoustic drums live performance along to her ultradigital music. With her recent latest release, 'SHuSH', RRUCCULLA defies all genres with her particular music vision, and with which Pitchfork, Stereogum, The New York Times, XLR8R or The Line of Best Fit already considered her as an emerging artist to take into account.

Seeking an intimate creative environment to develop their musical concepts, Kinsella and Pulse journeyed deep into isolation. “We packed the car and drove 13 hours to The Millay Colony in upstate New York: an artist’s colony in The Berkshires, miles down a private road, next to 100,000 acres of national forest,” Kinsella shares. On arrival, the couple devised a unique artistic process to work from, Kinsella describes it as a “collaborative conscious alignment.” The most unique aspect of this creative method involves the writing of the album’s lyrics. “We agreed on 12 books we thought most relevant and came up with various systems to collapse and collage them into each other in different combinations,” Kinsella says. That list included titles ranging from Don Quixote to The Outlaw Bible of American Poetry. Drawing from this source material, Kinsella and Pulse employed a sort-of literary mash-up, scrambling content and structure into a thoroughly new product. “We might take the form of an Eskimo genesis Programming descriptions are generated by participants and do not necessarily reflect the opinions of SXSW.|30.26960979999999|-97.73635829999999

In our time of division, the four-piece brings their contexts into the forefront...unabashedly reimagining through their (mostly) brown mouths, the sound of white Americana owned by the Lous, Bobs, and Iggys. Paste Magazine heralded them as one of NYC’s must know bands of 2018. Their debut EP, Songs Born From Love and Hate dropped in November 2017 via PaperCup Music/Buen Dia Records. Remezcla called it “rock, with plenty of melody and attitude, resulting in a collision of classic CBGBs punk, and power pop melodies.” Native Sun reflects the sound of immigrant America, as noted by Noisey.  Frontman Danny Gomez met lead guitarist Jake Pflum as a kid in Florida. Life led them apart and reunited them on a random evening in the city. They rekindled their friendship over their mutual obsession with The Rolling Stones, VU, T. Rex, Neil Young, etc. Immediately, they forced their best friend Alexis Castro to pick up the drum sticks. Bassist Mo Martinez came to them at the height of 2016’s turmoil after uprooting from Monterrey, Mexico and naturally completed the band’s lineup.

The trio grew up together in Los Angeles and there's a shared understanding of what makes them all tick. Together with her punk cohorts Anastasia Sanchez (vocalist/drummer, 20), guitarist Isabelle Fields (19), and bassist Eva Chambers (19) have a clear understanding that Pinky Pinky's modus operandi is in not overthinking their decisions. You can hear that on their debut album, 'Turkey Dinner' due on Innovative Leisure. It follows their two prior EPs, most recently 2018's 'Hot Tears'. Their first full-length, however, is even freer than their previous efforts. It's a patchwork quilt of garage rock and oddball indie. It's rooted in classic bass, drums, guitar, but it's bolstered by the perspectives of a trio of LA youths writing about their everyday observations, anxieties and passions.Programming descriptions are generated by participants and do not necessarily reflect the opinions of SXSW.|30.26960979999999|-97.73635829999999

A Brooklyn DIY super group of sorts, Public Practice combines members of freshly-dead punk project WALL and local pop band Beverly. Public Practice backs their ambitious song writing with serious chops, their live shows already pulling them into the sharp foreground of a scene growing all too warm-and-fuzzy. Sam York’s lyrics reflect the city and it’s contradictions—they are personal, funny, cryptic and surreal, but never truly pessimistic, rotating around an individual’s toxic but symbiotic relationship with perception. Songs like the sarcastically-titled “Foundation” deep-fry Beach Boys guitars in ice-cold-but-somehow-funky Scritti Politti grooves. Add a dead pan David Byrney vocal, and Public Practice remind us again how integral it is to use honesty and self-reflection to bring some of life’s double-standards to light.

A multimedia project at heart, The Wants see their music as a component of a wider artistic universe designed to communicate their perspective. Velding-VanDam's attention to detail extends to the graphic and product design, marketing materials, and the filming and editing of their video content. He found a wealth of inspiration in ""Pleasures and Terrors of Domestic Comfort"" a 1991 retrospective of American photography. Each member is highly active in the Brooklyn scene: Lydia Gammill is the egoslob ""Gustaf""; Jason Gates drums for veterans ""Veda Rays""; and Madison Velding-VanDam is the guitarist and a composer for ""BODEGA"".

The first of these songs will be heard on her debut LP ‘HiiDE’, out in 2019 on Deathwaltz Originals which was in parts co-produced by Adrian Sherwood and focuses on the key themes of hiding and secrets. Some tracks have already snuck out in strange forms on Iglooghost’s Diplo & Friends mix for BBC Radio 1 and have been heard while supporting him on tour around the UK. BABii recently made new friends with Iglooghost, umru, Kai Whiston and Abi Wade but having been left unsupervised they created more songs, some of which can be found on the internet, others of which are still HiiDDEN.

The Guildford-based singer-songwriter has been backed across tastemaker platforms as one of the most vitally sarcastic voices in the indie scene, with praise coming from key press voices in The Independent, the Fader and The Line of Best Fit as well as on the airwaves. ‘Beat the Birds’, taken from 2018’s ‘Sorry I’m Not Perceptible’ EP, found its place on the Radio 1 BBC Introducing Playlist and she earned herself a spot on the lineup of BBC Music’s The Biggest Weekend in Swansea. Huw Stephens is a vocal supporter of Annabel’s music and premiered her latest single ‘Fear Naught’ ahead of her Maida Vale live session. 'Fear Naught' also featured on Spotify's New Music Friday editorial playlist. 2018 saw Annabel perform at the likes of Boardmasters, Siren Festival, Neverworld and Reading Festival, and she embarked on her first UK headline tour on which she played her biggest headline show to date at The Moth Club in London. 2019 started with Allum heading into the studio to work on new material.

Her haunting voice is hypnotic, her sensual songs like spells that sweep you out of the everyday and off to somewhere exotic. As a baby, Malena sang herself to sleep. As a musician, she may have magical powers. Aliso, her debut album, both drifts like a dream and packs a powerful punch. Entirely written, played and produced by Malena, its ten tracks owe a debt to Beach House, Brian Eno, Tame Impala, Cuban folk musician Silvio Rodriguez and an addictive Argentinean tea called Yerba Mate that fuelled its recording. Its songs are as much about capturing emotions as they are about telling tales. Its spectral beauty is bewitching. Having sung since her teens, but never previously written or produced, Malena took a freewheeling approach to composing. She made the album, mostly in her parents’ garage, as an experiment more than an introduction, intending to upload it to Soundcloud to see if anyone noticed... Following her debut release and heavy touring around Europe and the UK with Lord Huron, Middle Kids and multiple festival appearances, Malena makes her first US appearance at SXSW 2019.

Forming as teenagers when frontman Rollo Doherty’s acoustic bedroom project was treated to the boisterous backing of guitarist Jack Raeder, bassist James Wolfe and drummer Toby Richards in a dingy windowless practice room where they began to shape a sound which combined darkly twisting instrumental with a sweetly melodic songwriting nous that belied their age. The quartet released their debut EP ‘Girl’ in late 2015 and its shimmering refrains immediately turned heads. Their follow up EP 'A Place You Like' continued their undeniable rise and further garnered new fans both domestically and internationally. Early 2018 they released their critically acclaimed debut album, ‘Feels Like Air’. The band’s live show is fearsomely tight and effervescently energetic through years of playing together week in, week out since their youth. Over the course of little more than a year, they sold out all their London headline shows including the iconic London KOKO and Scala, and shows at The Great Escape, London Calling and Reeperbahn.

Born to Sudanese and Scottish parents and raised across seven countries, she is the descendent of a long line of progressive artists and academics dating back to the 1800s. She holds an MPhil in Philosophy, speaks four languages and is a graduate in Jazz from the Guildhall School. She is a complex character, impossible to pigeon-hole as she constantly redefines herself. Key to the respect the industry shows for Eliza’s work is the fact that she manages to be both a serious grafter and a true fighter for that which she believes in. Her debut album Future is a body of work she has fought tooth and nail to complete. Set on the bedrock of Eliza’s early folk and grunge influences, it revels in “flavours of trip-hop, West-Coast surf sounds, 80’s chorus, 90’s movie soundtracks, and all-out pop” while still managing to sound like a focused, devastatingly precise and cohesive body of work. Eliza has toured across the UK and Europe and is looking forward to playing her first shows in the US at SXSW.

Despite it's bold title and seemingly warm connotations, upcoming single and first taster of their new material single Hot Summer was conceived on a very grey day in London. The pair tried to capture ""that feeling of despair when everyone around you is happy, but somehow you just don't feel it"" and produced by Richard X (Roisin Murphy, Goldfrapp, Kelis,) the result is no-nonsense anti-summer anthem. The Hot Summer festival tour included playing a bumper section of over 20 European festivals this year, including performances at Rock Am Ring, Melt, Fusion, Deichbrand, Lollapalooza Berlin and many more.

Her DIY invention has stemmed not only from necessity - learning how to launch electronic loops live so she didn’t have to drag her keyboard to early pub gigs - but also from a desire to retain total creative control. Several major label overtures have been entertained down the years, but ultimately Bettinson has always preferred to pursue her own artistic vision. “I like my pop music a little bit weird,” she says. “I like it to challenge, to push the envelope a little bit — not just repeat what’s gone before.” This has been the case ever since those early performances, which earned Bettinson the attention of Radiohead producer Nigel Godrich, who recruited her to front electronic alt-pop group Ultraísta. Following rave reviews from Pitchfork, The Guardian and Rolling Stone, Bettinson then took a sabbatical to launch her solo career as FEMME.

Each sound in his mind-blowing performances is played by robots. Small motors beat on metal, 3D-printed robo-kalimbas vibrate with deep bass sounds, salvaged parts from old hard drives click and cut. Over several years Moritz Simon Geist committed to build, tweak, test and play all of his DIY robotic instruments. Geist’s ‘Sonic Robots’ push the boundaries of the imaginable and invent a new plurality in music creation. In electronic music, many imagine humans playing machines. Few imagined these music machines being actual robots. In 2012, Geist ventured into this exploration with the invention of his well-known oversized MR-808 robot. Now, he goes even further to pioneer the unknown and futuristic sound world of ‘Robotic Electronic Music’. In this quest, Geist teamed up with the Berliner sound alchemists ‘Mouse On Mars‘ to dig deep into the history of mechanical music and experiments of early electronic music. In 2018 he releases the first ever techno record made with only robots on his Label SRR with help from KOMPAKT.

Incoming full length ‘In The Blank Space’ takes this conversation further, a broad but stunningly concise exposition of supple strings, textured vocals, and digital excursions. One thread that consistently moved through her work are those gorgeous classical elements; whether that’s her treatment of melody on the supple, piano-driven ‘Once Apart’, her exploration of tone on ‘Feral Thing’, or simply incorporating a string quartet on the title track, ‘In The Blank Space’ points to the future while looking back to her past. “I think that’s maybe why I’m not only an electronic artist, but I’m also not just a singer-songwriter,” she insists. “I do both. I produce and I write songs."" Her technical autodidacticism is allied to a searing ambition, an unrelenting creativity. It’s the sound of someone who utterly loves music bringing this creativity into resolute focus, a conversation between the organic and the digital, between her inner world and that urge towards communication.

The seven-track LP is Brandt’s biggest statement yet, with the album’s thrilling avant-garde framework interweaving chord-driven techno, orchestral flourishes, rich electronic textures and hints of dark cinematic pop. Following on from 2017's Eternal Something, which captured a contemplative kind of isolationism, with Channels Brandt set out to create an album that captures the essence of minimalism whilst lending it to a more playful context.  After performing and recording Steve Reich’s Six Pianos in a group of six, Brandt began regularly composing long meditations on the piano, something that permeates the sound of the new record. Its frenetic energy and shape-shifting identity was also born out of touring with his new band Eternal Something — comprised of Brandt on piano, drums and synthesisers, Pascal Bideau on guitar and bass, plus Florian Juncker on trombone — and a desire to translate both the sound and spiritual unity of their live shows in which musicians locked together to create an intriguing meld of expansive works.

I was born and raised in Berlin and grew up studying art and physics, while immersed in Berlin’s clubbing scene. I started making music by programming and building little synthesizers. I built virtual synths and microphones and used them to record sounds of found materials or wired environments.  I released a vinyl last year, as my first release, a conceptual work, which features sounds generated from some of my black glass sculptures which I sonified through a synthesis system I built.  I live between Berlin and L.A. Last year I performed in a lineup with Lady Starlight and DJ Koze, which I loved to see happen and I have performed my work at the big European art + music festivals such as CTM Berlin and Ars Electronica in Linz.

Taking inspiration from artists like HOMESHAKE, Tame Impala and more, Hernandez sought to combine a dreamy synth-drenched sound with influences from growing up east of Los Angeles, CA – the sounds of growing up east of a major metropolitan city, of being young and brown in America. Katzù Oso’s music is written entirely in his bedroom but since the drop of his first single, “Sophie” in April of 2017, Katzù Oso has been growing quickly: from performing at backyard shows in his hometown of Montebello, CA to performing at venues such as Highland Park’s The Hi Hat and Los Angeles’ The Resident. Katzù Oso released his debut mixtape 'PASTEL' on July 20, 2018.  2019 holds more touring + a sophomore mixtape follow-up to 'PASTEL' for Katzù Oso.

The band consists of Henry Vargas on guitar and vocals, Jose Corona on drums, and their good friend Patrick Juarez helping on bass. The group started in the summer of 2014, when Jose and Henry got together with talks of forming another band having known each since high school and playing in different groups, separately and together. Things took off from there as they both shared similar influences, similar backgrounds and similar mindsets and visions.  They started as a duo, with their first gig together being an open mic at a church. The duo became a trio and started playing anything from house parties, to bars, to coffee shops, to open mics. Things started moving fast as the release of ‘We Bring Anything to the Table… Except Tables, We Can’t Bring Tables to the Table’, garnered unexpected attention. They have continued playing and noticed a growth in their audience throughout the years since.  With a very loyal and supportive fan base, and with their latest record, ‘For Today, For Tomorrow, For What Is, For What Could’ve Been’, the group is reaching new heights and new territory.

With support already from from the likes of Gorilla vs Bear, XLR8R and Stereogum, their appearances at SxSW will be their first in the US. Like all good projects, this one started with a manifesto. “Let’s aim small and let it be big,” the pair wrote in a lengthy document guiding the recording process of debut album First Body, out via Liberation Records (Vance Joy, Julia Jacklin) and Terrible Records (Solange, Blood Orange) January 2019. Phoebe and Joey weren’t exactly sure what kind of music would come out of those early sessions in 2015, but they were clear on how they wanted to do things. Their art would be sustainable, long-term, and almost entirely self-made. It’d be guided by bold visual cues, DIY principles, and artists that emphasise the empty space between notes as much as the notes themselves; artists such as James Blake, Caribou, and Jamie xx. “The music, above all else has to move you, physically and emotionally,” they wrote.

Thus, HIJOS vibrates with the sound of a city where the rhythm vibrates with a sophisticated subtlety between the trumpet, the jukebox, vinyl and the guitar. The band’s first album, NU9VE, was dropped in 2016; several video clips and live sessions were released as part of their promotion. Recently, HIJOS was in charge of the soundtrack for the short El Gran Líbano, which was included in the film Lebanon Factory, which premiered at the prestigious Cannes Film Festival (2017).

Following the release of his last EP ‘Drivers’ in 2016, Nick took a step back and submerged himself in his music in order to discover what he originally wanted to say as an artist and making sure that was present in his art moving forward. Nick reemerged in 2018 with a newly reimagined sound established by the release of his two, psychedelic new singles “Ticking” and “Lemons” off his forthcoming project due out in 2019. Music being at the fusion of his classical piano skill, Nick brings forth a distinct knack for crafting romantic, evocative records filled with sonic texture and color. Throughout his two previous EP’s, numerous Hype Machine #1 singles, viral secret side projects and production/writing credits for artists across multiple genres on major labels, Nick’s sound is both undoubtedly one of a kind, and instantly recognizable.

Beginning as a form of escapism a pop music  obsession began. It’s these past lives & vivid influences that are reimagined and  regurgitated into debut  Mysterious  Visions. Within 8 weeks in the real world, Nancy has been been described as a musical auteur, a surrealist king, a mysterious newcomer, a provocateur, both male and female, a necromancer, in the same sentence both classy and trashy, weird and wonderful. Recorded, produced, art-directed by Nancy the none-the-same 7-songs-long ‘EP’ is  proof of concept.

The first track, and album’s single, is “Dreaming,” a pure 90’s style pop theme.  It’s a  perfectly uncomplicated melody that just sneaks in – intact – as if it had always been with you, to make a cool start of things.   The album continues with “I luv U,” where Bigott jumps in to his deep space ship for a trip of guitars and love.  Simplicity addicts! “Sweet Sweet Bang Bang” comes in without knocking; dark and potent, in a new register from Bigott’s versatile universe.  Its depth diving with distorsion tanks. Then its time for “Release”: broken psychedelic love.  Junkyard sound for this heart-on-his-sleeve instrumental, vindicating the beautiful in all forms. Here comes “Baby” and the temperature rises. Hot is sexy - the groove of Bigott’s voice whispering warm in your ear.  A loop softly out of focus that conforms the soundscape to a singular sexual harmonic.

Newski has played over 1200 shows on every continent except Antarctica. Most recently he's been supporting Violent Femmes, PIXIES, Chuck Ragan, & New Pornographers in the US.  His latest LP, ""Life Upside Down"" was produced by Hutch Harris of Sub-Pop & Saddle Creek legends The Thermals and engineered by Beau Sorenson (Death Cab for Cutie, Superchunk, Bob Mould), ""Life Upside Down"" is a beautiful catharsis to a happier brain and sense of belonging. If you frequently find yourself stuck in your own head traffic, this record might help get you free. Brett Newski has certainly kicked his own ass over the past 6 years, touring infinitely (mostly alone) and wandering down the rabbit hole of anxiety, depression, and wallowing self-doubt. All of these negatives have blossomed into positive creative energy on his third LP.  ""Anxiety can actually be a good thing. If you use it right, that nervous energy can be channeled into motivation or creativity,"" explains Newski.

While others my age were out with their friends, I was in my bedroom singing and writing songs. For a long time, it was my little secret. Until my freshman year of high school when I uploaded my first YouTube cover online. I slowly built a following around my music, but it wasn’t until I came out as gay that my music and following grew exponentially. I began writing love songs about my girlfriend and sharing my experience as a gay demigender woman. My most recent work is influenced by a diverse body of music, combining elements from acoustic singer-songwriter music with elements from electronic music and R&B. My goal is to change the pop music industry and give LGTBQ+ love and relationships the representation that they deserve. I want my music to be enjoyed by everyone, including those outside of the LGBTQ+ community. I wish my younger self would have been able to hear a song on the radio written by a girl for a girl or see a woman who values her masculinity. For this reason, I strive to be the role model I never had.  Programming descriptions are generated by participants and do not necessarily reflect the opinions of SXSW.|30.2694462|-97.74106689999999

Except, the brass instruments are so filtered and effected that they often sounds more like synths, if not... horses. Real synths and drum machines are also programmed in their tracks adding texture and occasional bleeps and squeaks. In 2017 alone, they released two purposefully unglued-sounding records featuring more than 20 tracks each. Their songs sound like brilliant semi-developed sketches, built on quirky, sparse electronic foundations and airy vocals following strange melodic paths.

Under her songwriting moniker Boy Scouts, the Bay Area artist has spent over a decade refining her craft, penning heartbreak confessionals over glitchy drum loops since Myspace days. It wasn't until 2015 that Vick put together a live band and became a staple of San Francisco and Oakland lineups. On her forthcoming album, it feels like Boy Scouts has truly arrived. Recorded and produced by Stephen Steinbrink, every element exists purely to serve the songs - the bass lines bounce and guitars are lush, but nothing gets in the way of Vicks true superpower, her voice. Delicately layered harmonies exude an effortless grace, and make the most casual lyrics hit the hardest. There's something so honest about her songs, they feel like late night therapy sessions with your best friend.

Always passionate, at times profane, Sarah stalks/walks the line between vulnerable and menacing, her voice strong and uneasy, country classic but with contemporary, earthy tension. You can hear in her voice what’s she’s seen; world weary, lessons learned—or not—but always defiant. She level-steady means what she says. Writing with a blunt urgency—so refreshing these days it's almost startling—Sarah's lyrics are in turn smart, funny, mean, and above all, uncompromising. Sly turns of phrase so spot on they feel as old and true as a hymn. Anger that's as confrontational as it is concise. Humor that's as wry and resigned as a park bench prophet.  The Disarmers hit all the sweet spots from Nashville’s Lower Broad to Bakersfield and take Sarah's unflinching tales out for some late-night kicks. At times, it’s as simple and muscular as Luther Perkins’ boom-chicka-boom, or as downtown as Johnny Thunders. The Disarmers keep in the pocket, tight and tough.

At first listen, illuminati hotties is a sun-drenched, irreverent volley with the onset of adulthood, but as the listener dives deeper, they will find an earnest consideration of musical phrasing and deliberately crafted wordplay regarding the complexity of love, loss, and skateboarding. illuminati hotties’ live show challenges audiences to bring their deepest feels and fiercest moves to the floor, and has elicited comparisons to Best Coast, Angel Olsen, Courtney Barnett, and Alvvays.

The influences range from noise rock icons like Gun Club and Grant Hart to modern garage rock acts Viva L'American Death Ray Music, Reigning Sound, The Golden Boys and back to mid-60s groove and R&B like The Grassroots, T.K. Hulin, Johnny Rivers, and Tommy James. Fake Eyelashes is the band's first new album since 2007's Beauty School (Emperor Jones, reissued in 2017 on Super Secret Records), and it will be released on Austin's Super Secret Records. It picks up right where the band left off, carrying the torch for great, under the radar rock 'n' soul. Much like underground lifers like Dead Moon or The Flamin' Groovies the band keeps marching to its own unique beat bucking the current trends and tropes of contemporary music.Programming descriptions are generated by participants and do not necessarily reflect the opinions of SXSW.|30.2603929|-97.7393064

Lemon Lime, the St. Louis four-piece’s appropriately titled sophomore full-length, is a sweet and sharp sonic confection, each song a push and pull of jagged distortion and rich melodies. The album finds Shady Bug--comprised of guitarist/vocalist Hannah Rainey, guitarist Tom Krenning, drummer Aaron O’Neill, and bassist Chris Chartrand (Todd Anderson plays bass the on this recording)--twisting their brand of noisy, dynamic guitar pop into new directions. Building on the promise of their 2017 debut, tbh idk, Lemon Lime further sharpens Shady Bug’s sound. “Make It Up” opens the album with a wall of explosive fuzz that barely gives the listener time to acclimate before shifting gears to a shimmering verse of interwoven guitars and Rainey’s warm voice. Her uniquely phrased melodies set the stage for the Lemon Lime’s lyrical explorations of late night hangouts, existential angst, and the poignancy of mundane moments—like the reference to sharing a can of Sprite that lends the record its’ title.

The band formed in 2013 and released their first EP ‘Sistah Punk’ in 2014 and the single ‘Crooked Room’ in 2016. The group released their debut album 'Sistahs' in November 2018 on Thurston Moore and Eva Prinz's new label Daydream Library Series. As part of London’s thriving DIY punk scene Big Joanie have played with locals Shopping; toured with US punks Downtown Boys; and Dutch Punk band The Ex; and performed at the first UK Afropunk festival. Big Joanie have described themselves as being “similar to The Ronettes filtered through ’80s DIY and Riot Grrrl with a sprinkling of dashikis.”  One of the main reasons for coming together was to create an atmosphere to be “completely ourselves as black women and discover what was possible to realise in those spaces.” Outside of the band all three members are involved in communitarian activities whether running the festival for punks of colour Decolonise Fest, volunteering at Girls Rock Camp, or leading the Stop Rainbow Racism campaign which works to stop racist performances in LGBT venues.

In spirit and performance however the band more closely epitomizes bands like Butthole Surfers, The Black Lips, and Fat White Family with their mischievous, iconoclastic, and grotesquely charming energy.  Both clever and aggressive, the band thrash through would-be-pop songs, observing their surrounding from the depths.  In the past year they have supported acts such as The Black Lips, Dead Boys, Surfbort, Roky Erickson, Tropical Fuck Storm, Shannon & The Clams, Jacuzzi Boys, Bodega, Bambara etc.  Gnarcissists just released their self titled EP, a raw 4-track 7” on their own BLISS label, and are currently in the process of finishing their first LP.

Initially a solo project, Stove has bloomed into a full-fledged band with the additions of drummer/vocalist Jordyn Blakely, bassist Alex Molini, and guitarist Mike Hammond. Now on their sophomore LP, the cheekily titled ‘s Favorite Friend, the band has truly come into their own to make an album that defines Stove’s identity and captures the four member’s extraordinary musical chemistry, as well as the joy and relief that can come from creating together in the midst of challenging times. Stove’s 2015 debut, Is Stupider, was an extension of Ovlov’s DNA, but Hartlett soon discovered that when separated from the sonic parameters and expectations of that band’s work, he felt free to try out different dynamics and sounds--an excitement that would grow along with Stove’s lineup during the writing and recording sessions that became  Programming descriptions are generated by participants and do not necessarily reflect the opinions of SXSW.|30.2603929|-97.7393064

Their music captures what frontman Rushforth calls “a dance of agony”: that space where we move to the rhythm of our own anxieties and desires. The result is a delicate breed of electronic music – a sound with an angelic John Maus on one shoulder, and a demonic David Byrne on the other. Greenwave Beth released their debut EP “People In Agony” through Dinosaur City Records in 2018, combining the restrictive and industrial sounds of midi-sequenced drum and bass with free form songwriting. It’s a coming-of-age story that's unnerving and electrifying at the same time.

Now a seasoned performer, Pat’s dexterous songwriting prowess has emerged. Quietly, he’s taking on America, on his own terms.  Moving to Austin, opened a whole new world. Said Byrne, “I’ve never felt so alive musically. Every night I go see a gig; and I’m blown away. I get opportunities to play with those people, and it’s inspiring.”  Pat recently released his new LP, “Rituals”. The artistic growth is clear; the authenticity is palpable. No one genre dictates the mix—and the tracks get better with each listening. “The results—Irish Americana, by turns rollicking and resonating, that’s driven by his gruff growl of a voice—suggest that he’s one to keep an eye on.” Stuart Munro, The Boston Globe “The raspy melodic soul of Byrne’s voice recalls the emotional spells the late Austin troubadour Jimmy LaFave used to cast, though Byrne’s songwriting bears a distinctive Irish stamp. He’s more contemporary than strict traditionalists, putting him more in the league of Glen Hansard or Luka Bloom, perhaps; yet at times he conjures a deeply old-school feel,” Peter Blackstock, Austin American Statesman Programming descriptions are generated by participants and do not necessarily reflect the opinions of SXSW.|30.25353389999999|-97.7635504

Their live performance has drawn comparisons to fiery indie rockers My Morning Jacket and Wilco, while Seattle-based curators Artist Home describe 2017's LP Strangers as “a tangle of beautiful, messy emotions, wrapped up in a sound that’s warmly familiar yet brimming with soul and tiny details that are touched by magic.

Though vitally settled in the city that bled rap music, a new path would take shape that would soon define his career. That path was songwriting. Though ingrained in his DNA through countless years of artistry, surrendering the pen to the needs of other artists was uncharted territory. This soon led to his departure from the city that represented what seemed like his lifelong dream to the city that sculpts, chisels and molds it. While opportunity was deep-seated in the concrete arms of the rigorous goliath, New York tested Shirazee’s resilience. Overcoming homelessness he soon signed his first publishing deal and found himself at the helm of songs by artists like Sting, Afrojack, Ty Dolla $ign, and more. Fast forward to 2018 and encompassing experience, influence and his widespread musical pallet, Shirazee releases “MAKE WILD”, a feel-great tune that calls for intentness in what has always been his foreordained playground.

Love makes you healthy and I’m convinced that one day, scientists will discover that it’s the basis of living, y‘know? Because we should all be loving people, and that’s the key message in my music. It’s all about love and progress.” Spiritual’s music transports us to another time, when reggae legends like Bob Marley first took the rebel sound of Jamaica to a worldwide audience. Authenticity can be heard in every note, but then it’s coming from the same source – not only musically and culturally, but even the same ghetto communities of West Kingston. Spiritual was raised in Allman Town, and sang in his local choir before embracing Rastafari. He was orphaned at an early age, and could have joined the throngs of young hopefuls at any number of studios and sound-systems scattered throughout the city. Instead, he shunned fame and helped to heal the broken society around him by counselling the poor and needy. Music was in his blood and he continued to write songs, but Rastafari was his true calling.

She set poems by Hughes in musical settings of her own construction on the critically acclaimed album, and her plain-spoken voice highlighted the common sense in Hughes’ works. McCalla moved to New Orleans in 2010 to busk on the streets. She also toured as part of the Carolina Chocolate Drops but left to pursue her own music and the project that threaded through it—an exploration of Haiti’s Creole culture and identity. McCalla connected with other Louisiana musicians who work with Creole traditions. That led to 2016’s A Day For The Hunter, A Day For The Prey, which reveals the art and humanity in folk songs. McCalla has kept her instrumentation spare to allow the song to shine, but her upcoming album, The Capitalist Blues, departs from that as she plays with a New Orleans-based band. The Capitalist Blues is different from McCalla’s previous albums, but she hears the connection between New Orleans and Haiti. Many of the themes are extensions of ones she examined on A Day for the Hunter, a Day for the Prey, and even though the lineups are very different, the songs come from the same place.

Africa is everywhere in Brazil, and it pulses through the music on Quebra Cabeça (Puzzle), Bixiga 70’s second studio album for Glitterbeat, where two continents dance together across the black Atlantic. The result still captures the incendiary excitement of Bixiga 70 live, but the freedom of the studio brings more shade and subtlety than before. The rhythms are more sinuous than ever, snaking through the funk in way that looks more to Ghana or Nigeria than Memphis or Muscle Shoals, while the horns strut in powerful harmonies. It’s music that forges connections and retraces history while sounding absolutely contemporary. But for Bixiga 70, African will always be the root, and Brazil its beautiful, vibrant flower.

Lead by Sophie Fustec who was born in Paris to her Venezuelan mother and French father. She grew up in Belleville, a neighbourhood in the 20th arrondissement of Paris, as well as Merida, in the west of Venezuela where she regularly went to see relatives on her mother’s side.

But if it’s true that listening to Da Chick is like travelling back in time, we should also think about the future as a mark for what this artist presents us: it’s a future where female creativity and freedom are not questionable at all and where this electronic dance, made in Portugal, still has a lot to give and inspire worldwide. Da Chick carries her name and image: new releases, but also design, styling, videos...  And on stage, alone or escorted by a full band, Da Chick makes sure you get the message on who’s the funk machine: her powerful and lightning live shows granted her a win for Best Live Performance Award in Portugal, to be invited by Peaches to sing on her show, and to open for massive Funk legends like Earth Wind and Fire and Maceo Parker.

Her DIY invention has stemmed not only from necessity - learning how to launch electronic loops live so she didn’t have to drag her keyboard to early pub gigs - but also from a desire to retain total creative control. Several major label overtures have been entertained down the years, but ultimately Bettinson has always preferred to pursue her own artistic vision. “I like my pop music a little bit weird,” she says. “I like it to challenge, to push the envelope a little bit — not just repeat what’s gone before.” This has been the case ever since those early performances, which earned Bettinson the attention of Radiohead producer Nigel Godrich, who recruited her to front electronic alt-pop group Ultraísta. Following rave reviews from Pitchfork, The Guardian and Rolling Stone, Bettinson then took a sabbatical to launch her solo career as FEMME.

The silver lining, however, is that the Austin-based songwriter excels at taking bumps in the road and turning them into gold. A week before Johnson was to begin tracking his fifth solo album, Hatteras Night, A Good Luck Charm, he hit one such bump: His usual studio haunt, the Echo Lab—where he’s recorded solo work, albums by his beloved former band Centro-matic and side projects such as South San Gabriel—suddenly became unavailable due to a fire. Luckily, a friend and collaborator, Britton Beisenherz (Monahans, Milton Mapes) stepped in and offered up his Austin, Texas, studio, Ramble Creek Recording. The last-minute switch was a blessing in disguise. First, the session now brought together both old friends (his Centro-matic bandmate Matt Pence, a pal of 27 years and the Echo Lab’s manager) and newer friends (Beisenherz, Ricky Ray Jackson, who’s worked with Phosphorescent and Steve Earle). In addition, this combination of musicians ended up unexpectedly adding more depth to the album’s desolate, folk- and Americana-leaning songs.

The members count the Beatles, Elton John, ELO, Blitzen Trapper and My Morning Jacket among their influences, but also have an affinity for sweeping film soundtracks, a passion that informs Eternal Reach.

Having formed the band while still in high school, the members first met at a time when each were independently serving as the “token girl” in various dude-bands from their hometown of Cincinnati, OH. Coming from varied musical backgrounds (ranging from garage-rock, to surf, to opera), the distinct talents and influences of each member collided in unexpected ways at the band’s first rehearsal. It was here the band discovered that their chemistry wasn’t rooted in a shared musical reference point, but in the creative relief from the expected censorship of being a sideperson. ​Produced by Yoni Wolf (WHY?), the new album Almost glides between palatial assuredness and pallid introspection, looking back on youthful yearning—the uncertainties, the traumas, the anxieties—without discounting its soft beauty.  The Ophelias steer Almost through the lineage of coming-of-age confessionals, and affectionately document their growth into a warm, fractured adulthood. ​ Programming descriptions are generated by participants and do not necessarily reflect the opinions of SXSW.|30.267722|-97.741123

Reflecting the working class background of Whitby Ontario, Chastity’s songs are charged with the ethos of archetypal youth on the fringe. It was clear from the release of Chastity’s first demos that this was not “another punk band that can operate at only one speed.” Always concerned with the trending lack of accessibility and inclusivity in public spaces for the arts, the first Chastity show was held in Williams’ own bedroom where, packed wall-to-wall, the police were quickly called. But after the project’s second show supporting DC punk band Priests, Chastity was off to the races, sharing stages with the likes of with Metz, Chelsea Wolfe and Fucked Up. All without a full length recording out. Released summer 2018 with Brooklyn Label Captured Tracks, 'Death Lust' follows the plot of suffering to survival. The album begins on a tortured note with ‘Come’ and builds toward the plummeting finale of ‘Chains’, evolving from start to finish in a crescendo of severity.

To date, Blessed has released one single with Toronto's Buzz Records (Weaves, Dilly Dally, Greys), and two critically lauded EPs.

Four out of Blessed’s five members cut their artistic and organizational teeth in a fiercely D.I.Y. community that developed in the most unlikely conditions. In the Fraser Valley’s sprawling collection of suburbs and farmlands, there is little cultural infrastructure. And there is even less municipal enthusiasm for the arts. It is a Lynchian setting that nurtures overt conservatism and covert creativity. Young Valley musicians were forced to creatively accommodate their burgeoning local music scene by whatever means available. They turned the basements of shared punk houses into venues.

And they’ve had some great company doing it, playing along-side some of their good buddies such as Dune Rats, Violent Soho, DZ Deathrays and Skegss as well as 50+ headlining shows around the world.  Taking some much needed downtime the Goochies spent the past summer relocating from LA, to their hometown of Newcastle to settle in for some songwriting and recording. The first tasty morsel is two-minute-forty-second feminist punk anthem (one for the ages!) 'Busy Bleeding', a poppy upbeat ode to “that time of the month”.  When tossing up who they wanted to release the first of what is guaranteed to be many smash hit singles, The Gooch Palms couldn’t look past their old pals Dune Rats and Ratbag Records! Label deal done, Busy Bleeding was quickly followed by 'Marfa Lights' - Goochies ode to their favourite US art hub in the West Texas high desert, Marfa. So go take an earful of Busy Bleeding & Marfa Lights and get ready for 2019 to be officially known as “YEAR OF THE GOOCH”!!! More songs and many more shows to come!

The group independently released its first album ""The Cart"" in August of 2016 and the follow up album ""The Horse"" in August of 2018. Everyone loves every track off of both albums. ""The Cart"" and ""The Horse"" were both written, mixed and produced by Warren Regan. They have garnered acclaim for being the first band to ever wear suits on stage. You will see them wearing their signature handsome-boy suits (unisex) during their live performances. Ceramic Animal's live show is known for being very slick as they cast an almost angelic aura whilst they perform their most righteous of numbers.

My sound is fragmented, raw and abstract, but also dreamy, driven, dark and clean. I am interested in music, which shows the algorithms used to produce it. My genre is a mix of minimalistic electronic music, sound art and alternative. I perform my music as a live coding session. I was born and raised in Berlin and grew up studying art and physics, while immersed in Berlin’s clubbing scene. I started making music by programming and building little synthesizers. I built virtual synths and microphones and used them to record sounds of found materials or wired environments.  I released a vinyl last year, as my first release, a conceptual work, which features sounds generated from some of my black glass sculptures which I sonified through a synthesis system I built.  I live between Berlin and L.A. Last year I performed in a lineup with Lady Starlight and DJ Koze, which I loved to see happen and I have performed my work at the big European art + music festivals such as CTM Berlin and Ars Electronica in Linz.  I am asked frequently to speak on the future of music and AR, VR, XR, AI at international conferences.

Inspired by Drum’n’bass, House, Groove music, Trip Hop, World music, and Jazz, they spontaneously create an alchemy of digital and organic sounds and take the audience on an ever-evolving journey.  Jason improvises using mathematical functions and AI to generate lush synth harmonies layered over polyrhythmic percussion-heavy grooves. His code and data visualizations of his process are projected during the performance. May’s voice ranges from meditative and ethereal, to deep and soulful, to jazzy and intricate. She augments her voice with digital processing, adding echoes, loops, reverbs, filters, and harmonies to her voice.  When the groove is right, she improvises entire songs from scratch, and when the music becomes complex she plays her voice like an instrumental soloist. The duo are connected in both the digital world, as their systems share information about rhythm and harmony, and in the analog world as May improvises over Jason’s music, while he steers the algorithms to follow the path of her musical phrasing.

As a Charlotte, NC native and current resident of Philadelphia, Ivy’s sound draws on a diverse set of influences. Sole is the product of the gospel and soul upbringing afforded by her hometown, the mainstream R&B and backpack hip hop of the late 90s and 2000s, and an organic obsession with indie rock that she’s cultivated into a soundscape that's all her own.    Sole's debut mixtape project EDEN was released in April 2016 to a welcoming community of hip-hop heads and hipsters alike, and it was ranked #27 on Bandcamp’s Best Albums of 2016 list. In 2017, she released the two-part project EAST and WEST and was featured as Spotify’s Fresh Finds spotlight artist.

From a stockpile he says is hundreds of songs deep, Ondara chose 11 for Tales of America. They’re captivating tunes built around acoustic guitars and adorned with subtle full-band accompaniment for an openhearted folk-rock feel.

Now, the group returns with Rocket (2018, Verve Forecast), their first new music in a dozen years—and as the title indicates, they remain a propulsive and unclassifiable force, a whirlwind of musical ideas and styles. The band members, of course, have all continued to create music and collaborate on other projects, but never lost touch. Every few years, Brickell would reconnect with guitarist Kenny Withrow, drummer Brandon Aly, bass player Brad Houser, and percussionist John Bush and they would improvise new songs. In 2017, when the band reunited for three sold-out benefit shows for La Rondalla arts school, their improvisational drive led to an album’s worth of new songs. Rocket bounces effortlessly between genres, from the disco strut of “Exaggerate” to the shimmering and propulsive “Superhero,” to the reggae lope of “Singing in the Shower.”  Programming descriptions are generated by participants and do not necessarily reflect the opinions of SXSW.|30.2685025|-97.739164

Being able to record at home only amplified his abilities, and a couple of EPs released on small indie labels attracted the attention of Columbia, who hoped he’d emerge as the next Ed Sheeran. But as comparisons with everyone from Deerhunter, Kurt Vile and Mac DeMarco to Chris Isaak and Lou Reed emerged, it was clear that he was instead destined to be the one and only Willie J Healey. It was a great experience with some ups and downs, but his goal was more simple and remains unchanged – to be able to write songs that he likes and then share them with audiences. His latest EP set to be released by new music champions YALA! Records. Everything is now in place for Willie J Healey to live up to his limitless potential. “I try not to be too aware of trends, so I can focus on writing the best song I can regardless of whether I think it will be cool or not.” He notes how the great albums of the ‘70s feel out of time in contrast to the booming drums and slick production that places many ‘80s records firmly within their era. “A timeless classic will never go out of fashion.” Programming descriptions are generated by participants and do not necessarily reflect the opinions of SXSW.|30.2685025|-97.739164

3832|Mar 13, 2019|200 E 8th St. Austin, TX, EUA|Matt Maltese|9:00pm|8:20pm|Central Presbyterian Church|Matt Maltese is a man of two halves. On one hand, his bone-dry wit, Leonard Cohen-style vocals and baroque flourishes give him an undoubtedly retro, troubadour appeal. It’s a quality that’s only bolstered by the 21-year-old’s North American parentage (“I feel a certain sense of homecoming [when I go to] Canada that I maybe don't have as much in England,” he says). On the other, this rising singer-songwriter is also a young Brit coming of age in a time of national turmoil, with a true talent for conveying the malaise of today’s world.  His debut Album Bad Contestant was produced by Jonathan Rado (Lemon Twigs, Foxygen) was released in 2018 to critical acclaim and combine often dark lyrical material with breezier melodies, in the vein of John Grant or a more offbeat Rufus Wainwright. Maltese’s complex, witty melancholy is certain to see his audience continue to grow, and, in expertly treading the path between opposites -  anxiety and levity, home and away, past and present - he is sure to have an exciting future.

She recently recorded a session for Stephens at Maida Vale. 2018 also saw her taking slots at Latitude festival and The Great Escape and dates with Haley Heynderickx, Elbow and Belle and Sebastien. Her latest EP, Wisdom Teeth is quite possibly the most eclectic Jealous of the Birds set to date: from the raw energy that drives the angular ‘Blue Eyes’ to the dexterous, playful indie-pop of ‘New York Has a Lump in Her Throat’; the dream-like ‘Kosikelu’ and the widescreen majesty of Clementina.

It is an expression of ‘Pie’ Kanyapak Wuttara’s ‘other twin’, a songstress in isolation existing in contrast to her waking life. Ali Thomas became concrete when the songs created in Pie’s bedroom took shape. Her acoustic guitar and soulful voice resonates a longing for creative realization and old lovers, bleeding emotional honesty. In 2014, Pie joined with guitarist ‘Rack’ Wipata Lertpanya and drummer ‘Taw’ Wannaphong Jangbumrung, combining a unique ambient Brit rock style with Pie’s distinctive folk sensibilities. What emerged was their unique and experimental sound.  In 2018, My Life as Ali Thomas has been focusing on creating new material and ‘Daydreaming’, their highly anticipated first single since 2016’s album ‘Paper’, will be released in November 2018, with a follow up single in early 2019. ‘Daydreaming’ is an evolution of the band’s signature sound, incorporating the 90s pop influences with their signature ambient, folk-rock sound.

For her self-produced debut album, There’s Always Glimmer, Gia Margaret crafted twelve gorgeously melancholic lullabies to combat her own insomnia, and to salvage some beauty from the brighter and darker moments of her life. There’s Always Glimmer explores relationships between friends, family members and significant others, often in past tense. Sparse verses isolate mundane moments of domestic and urban life, and choruses ache with earnest expressions of yearning and loss. The disarmingly simple language of Gia Margaret’s lyrics, when carried by the melodic sparkle of her singing voice, have the power to elevate an ordinary moment into something supremely nostalgic and sentimental. A ride on a train, a hand on a shoulder, a dog in a yard, the light of the moon through an apartment window are each made significant and sacred, worthy of examination and preservation.

Fans of Elliot Smith, Death Cab for Cutie, and Alvin & The Chipmunks might gravitate towards Big Phony’s sound.  Catch him in the 2019 music feature film “Fiction & Other Realties” loosely based on his life as a sad singer-songwriter.

That’s likely been the one constant since establishing their giddy brand of protopunk and garage rock on debut LP 'The First Stirrings Of Insect Life'. Iguana’s pending follow-up 'Nude Casino' marks a swift and sobering departure from the miasma of psychedelics they purvey so fervently. But no less intense: this band has been sharpening their tools, reemerging from their concrete cavern with a ragged and convulsive post-punk attack akin to Devo, The Gun Club, and Richard Hell. Playing an abundance of shows – at small clubs, squats and festivals such as The Great Escape, Lowlands, c/o pop, Plissken and Reeperbahn – has whipped Iguana into even more ferocious live band, and that experience carries over in the recordings. Like The Clash and Minutemen before them, Iguana Death Cult have embraced the art of rocking the fuck out with all senses and impulses up to eleven.

3852|Mar 14, 2019|1502 E 6th St. Austin, TX, EUA|Valley Maker|8:30pm|7:55pm|Hotel Vegas|Valley Maker is the songwriting project of South Carolina-bred, Seattle-based musician and PhD student in Human Geography, Austin Crane. His new album, Rhododendron, was released October 12 on Frenchkiss Records. This new record reflects both the rootedness and rootlessness that shapes Crane's songwriting on the precipice of his third decade. Named for the common plant which springs up in both Crane’s native south and his current home in Washington, Rhododendron is an album about transition, about leaving, but also arriving, a document of the journeys in-between.  The album was recorded between two locales. In Portland, OR, Crane teamed with producer Chaz Bear of Toro y Moi. Longtime friends and schoolmates from the University of South Carolina, Bear and Crane laid the groundwork for the record, playing all instruments in tracking four songs between themselves. The rest of the record was tracked in Seattle with producer Trevor Spencer (Father John Misty, Fleet Foxes), enlisting drummer James Barone (Beach House, Tennis) and bassist Eli Thomson (Father John Misty) and longtime collaborator Amy Fitchette to round out Rhododendron's lush but spacious sound.

Originally formed in 1980, The Chills had a revolving cast of band members with Phillipps remaining the only constant. His knack for writing fantastic pop songs led to chart hits back home and a cult following around the world.  With early releases via the legendary NZ label Flying Nun, The Chills produced a number of critically acclaimed recordings such as the single “Pink Frost” (their first hit) from the compilation album Kaleidoscope World and “Wet Blanket” from the LP Brave Words.  Joining influential labels Creation and Homestead, they then moved to Warner Brothers imprint Slash and onto the world of majors. The BBC's John Peel invited them in for a number of BBC sessions (1985/1987/1988) which were released for the first time 2017. The Chills live energy is the central reason why The Chills are remembered fondly in all of the 39 countries that they have thus far visited. It’s the combination of this AND the consistent quality of their songs which have established The Chills as one of the most well-known New Zealand groups to date - particularly in the US, UK and Europe.

Comprised of Luke Koz (guitar, vox), Jess Rees (guitar, keys, vox) and joined by Kyle Garvey (bass) and Steve Levine (drums), the band has been honing their craft and chemistry since their split single, “Ambulance / Ghost.” Next, Russian Baths EP, Penance, was released on Good Eye Records. Incorporating dissonance into traditional song structures, Russian Baths aesthetic recalls Big Black’s caustic fits, ’70s space rock, Chapel Hill’s noise pop, Big Muff driven grunge, and the angular arrangements of British post-punk. The breadth of Russian Bath’s scope in sound is marked by the distance and cohesion between singles in the furious, driving “Slenderman” and the elegant thunderstorm that is “Poolhouse.” Programming descriptions are generated by participants and do not necessarily reflect the opinions of SXSW.|30.263413|-97.727159

It traces Krol’s journey back to punk rock, harnessing both the guitar technique and the musical redemption referenced in its title. He’s wielding the same influences—Misfits, The Strokes, early Weezer, Ramones—but turning up the gravity and the gain. Indeed, Krol has gone somewhere new; yes, he bludgeoned himself with over-analysis and self-loathing, but along the way he stumbled upon a trove of intricate guitar lines and artfully mutating melodies. Music ruined Krol’s life. And then saved it. In chronicling that process, Krol has made his best record—painful, voyeuristic, and angry, but ultimately transcendent and timeless. It is the sound of Krol giving in to a force greater than himself, as though the chords are playing him rather than the other way around.

Grivo’s massive tones and effects are utilized as active compositional elements, brilliantly crafting and pacing their infectious riffs to allow the saturated guitars and bruising low-end to fully bloom. Born and raised in small-town Michigan, Grivo is led by guitarist/vocalist Timothy Heck who founded the band with his brother and drummer Matthew. The Heck brothers have shared a life-long musical partnership, starting as jazz-obsessed teenagers before diving into the punk and hardcore scenes of the Midwest in their early twenties. After years of intensive touring, they sought new inspiration and slower tempos, opting to relocate to Austin in 2015. Timothy adopted a reserved and accessible approach to songwriting, evoking empathy through minor key signatures while constructing intricate walls of auditory mass. Within the tidal sound waves and bleak timbre, Grivo forges a distinctive personal connection that challenges the modern definitions of doom metal and shoegaze Programming descriptions are generated by participants and do not necessarily reflect the opinions of SXSW.|30.263413|-97.727159

All of this told through the eyes of a recently diagnosed Palermo suggesting he is dealing with the early stages of CTE, a neurodegenerative disease found in people with serious head injuries. Palermo spews songs of heightened confusion, anxiety, paranoia, depression, and chronic battles with physical pain- a result of his unstable past and more recent illness. These themes, spoken in a lush angelic language are juxtaposed against the band's now signature apocalyptic, reverberating wall of shimmering sound.

Deeply inspired by the move to Los Angeles and the bliss of new love, she rented a back house from an actor friend who was away on a movie and started writing the songs that eventually became Cosmic Wink. As she wrote, her beloved dog Frankie began going gray with old age. All three of these seemingly dissimilar streams intersected to give Cosmic Wink a unified sound and feel. The openness of LA — and confronting the downbeat nature of her older songs while performing to hushed European crowds — challenged her supposition that “heartache, depression, and sadness” were “the only way to make interesting music,” as she puts it. “You’re asking a lot if you expect an audience to be completely silent during your set and listen to every word.

Ohtis originally formed when Swinson and co-founder Adam Pressley were at high school in Normal, Illinois. They self-released their first material on small run CD-Rs while still teenagers.  By 2009, Swinson's addiction became life-threatening. Pressley and pedel steel player Nate Hahn had to distance themselves and the band dissolved. They kept in touch whilst living in different parts of the country, swapping ideas and songs online, never planning to release them, in equal parts because of their traumatic falling-out, and Sam's ongoing addiction to heroin.

Surfbort’s live experience is visceral and confrontational. Their feedback-strafed, guitar-shredding punk music says no to a digital age full of intolerance; they radiate love and friendship. All are welcome in the SURFBORT FREAK FAMILY! Fresh off a tour with The Black Lips after playing this year’s Coachella, the band just released ‘Bort to Death’ a raw 4-track 7” on Hozac Records. In the last three years they have supported acts such as The Dickies, Thee Oh Sees, Fat White Family, White Fang, The Fall, Martin Rev, The Garden, Tijuana Panthers, The Mystery Lights, Tomorrows Tulips, Sunflower Bean, DIIV, GOGGS, The Dune Rats, Leftover Crack etc. A favorite among local artists, it is no wonder when Julian Casablancas caught wind of the Surfbort’s raunchy energy, he signed them to Cult Records.

Bilingual member Nic Perea, who is originally from Mexico, contributes songs in Spanish that shape the band’s sound with a Latin influence. Matt Benson and Brian Larson, both graduates of the jazz program at VCU, hold the group close together with their technical talents. The band released their first record in 2016 with the help of local friends Citrus City Records and Crystal Pistol Records. The group then began to tour up and down the east coast in support of their first release. A year later, the band released a more polished EP titles “Juice EP” through Egghunt Records.

The bands efforts were rewarded in the summer of 2018 with a support tour opening for Stone Temple Pilots. Camp Howard has continued to tour and grow with an emphasis on tight musicianship and honest self-expression.

Amyl and the Sniffers quickly developed a reputation for their unhinged live performances, in which manic lead singer Amy Taylor can often be seen crowd surfing or climbing up the walls.  A break-out act at UK showcase festival The Great Escape, Amyl and The Sniffers were introduced to US audiences on a 22-date North American tour supporting King Gizzard and the Lizard Wizard, pulling rave reviews. 2018 saw the band sign to Gizz’s Flightless Records for Australia/NZ and to ATO Records/Flightless for North America. Following multiple sold out shows in the UK and Europe, the band signed to Rough Trade Records for the rest of the world.

3884|Mar 15, 2019|1502 E 6th St. Austin, TX, EUA|Gong Gong Gong|11:40pm|11:00pm|Hotel Vegas Annex|工工工 (Gong Gong Gong) is the duo of Tom Ng and Joshua Frank. Formed in 2015 in Beijing, China, they make music from the sparest of means: one guitar and one bass, interweaving riffs and rhythms to create forward-charging, drummerless grooves. Their inspirations extend from Bo Diddley to African and Southeast Asian folk music, psychedelic drone, and the structures of electronic music.  Together, the duo explore the concept of “phantom rhythm”—between their two instruments, an aura of ghostly snare hits emerges over a thumping low-end pulse. Atop this framework, Ng sings in his native Cantonese, recounting tales of absurdity and fragmented visions. Active members of the Chinese music underground, Gong Gong Gong have nonetheless remained an anomaly—outsiders who call Beijing their home. After a series of self-released tapes recorded in underpass tunnels, subterranean art spaces, and on weathered 50-year-old guitars in a Hong Kong high-rise rehearsal studio, Gong Gong Gong released their first US single, Siren 追逐劇 on Brooklyn’s Wharf Cat Records in November 2018.

As a three-peice comprised of twin brothers Blaze (drums) and Reid Bateh (vocals) and their childhood friend William Brookshire (bass), the band moved from Georgia to NYC to release their debut LP Dreamviolence, followed by Swarm in 2016. The significantly more expansive and refined sound captured on 2018’s Western Gothic concept album Shadow On Everything (Wharf Cat Records) has catapulted the band since its release. Their pummeling, unpredictable live set has made them favorites in New York City. After opening for IDLES in Brooklyn, Bambara was immediately asked by the band to support them on their US tour. Additionally, Bambara has toured the US and Europe extensively alongside the likes of Metz, Girl Band, APTBS, Liars, Nothing, Algiers and more.

His group Oh Sees (aka Thee Oh Sees, OCS, The Oh Sees, etc) have transmogrified to fit many a moment – from hushed druggy folk to groovy demonic pop chants to science fictional krautrock expanse and beyond – to suit his omnivorous whims. It’s common knowledge however, that at their shows, you’re there asking for a beating. 20 years going and the shows keep getting more and more intense, as many a soupy swarm can attest. The locked-in Rincon/Quattrone drum cops propel masses of strangers to froth and lean into each other as the insistent and repetitive underpinning tumbles nimbly from Tim Hellman’s bass. Meanwhile John ricochets breathy yips and snippets of synth and all manner of guitar heroics around your brain canyons while your reptile instincts yell “move”. Brain-stem body rock meets cerebral expanses, and their now du jour prolifically feeds a labyrinthine garden of well-hewn tunes.

There’s undeniable songwriting chemistry between guitarist Camilo Medina and bassist Javier Forero, who met as kids in Bogotá, Colombia and years later reconnected by sheer happenstance after their families had both moved to Miami. Now Chicagoans, their rhythmic, soulful --and at times bilingual --Latinx punk songs are a reflection of their continent-spanning bond and proof that Divino Niño couldn’t have formed without unlikely but happy coincidences. After cutting their teeth in southern Florida bands, Forero and Medina decamped to Chicago in 2010 to study at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago. There they met guitarist Guillermo Rodriguez and together, the three became roommates in 2013 and started recording the earliest Divino Niño demos. Drummer Pierce Codina caught wind of these demos and joined shortly after. Divino Niño's new single ""Foam"" was released January 29th via Winspear.

A Brooklyn DIY super group of sorts, Public Practice combines members of freshly-dead punk project WALL and local pop band Beverly. Public Practice backs their ambitious song writing with serious chops, their live shows already pulling them into the sharp foreground of a scene growing all too warm-and-fuzzy. Sam York’s lyrics reflect the city and it’s contradictions—they are personal, funny, cryptic and surreal, but never truly pessimistic, rotating around an individual’s toxic but symbiotic relationship with perception. Songs like the sarcastically-titled “Foundation” deep-fry Beach Boys guitars in ice-cold-but-somehow-funky Scritti Politti grooves. Add a dead pan David Byrney vocal, and Public Practice remind us again how integral it is to use honesty and self-reflection to bring some of life’s double-standards to light.

Pretty Groovy marks the first studio album from Faux Ferocious and their first LP release with Burger Records After years of subsistence recording on every broken Tascam machine in Middle Tennessee, Faux Ferocious took their figure-it-out approach to freak out rock n’ roll and hit the road to work with audio whiz Drew Vandenberg at the famed Chase Park Transduction in Athens, GA. They ate together, smelled each other and broke down the ego achieving an instinctive sound that allows expert musicianship and simple, evocative lyrics to work as one highlighting the duality of space and constraint. This record finds the sweet spot. It is angular and arresting, it is fast, it is repetitive, it is kosmische, it is punk. It drones, it loops and swirls around. It is guitar rock for people who wonder what it would be like if Ron Asheton and Michael Rother were also in Crazy Horse. The songs on this album allow each musician to stand out without taking over.

With the rugged power of a flashy Super Chief locomotive, the Banditos’ self-titled debut album bodaciously appropriates elements of ‘60s blues-fused acid rock, ZZ Top’s jangly boogie, garage punk scuzz a la Burger Records, the Drive-By Truckers’ yawp, the populist choogle of CCR, Slim Harpo’s hip shake baby groove, the ebullient folk of electric Dylan, gut bucket Fat Possum hill country mojo and the Georgia Motherf**king Satellites.

The 12 original tracks punch a necessary hole in the 21st Century landscape, both sonically and spiritually. The expansive, new territory that the New York City-based trio cover on Lowdown Ways is thanks to producer Jimmy Sutton (JD McPherson Band) who applies his technical know-how to broaden the sound of such instantly memorable tunes as “Pink Lemonade” (co-written by McPherson), “Ding Dong Dang” and “Bad Neighborhood,” which resonate with the down-and-dirty roots that have always been DADDY LONG LEGS’ inspiration. Meanwhile, the band ventures successfully into unfamiliar territory with the pub-rock-style “Winners Circle,” the bittersweet acoustic ballad “Back Door Fool” and the dramatic album-closer “Wrong Side of the River.” Written in the great cities of Brooklyn and Nashville and recorded on the Southside of Chicago at Hi-Style Studio, the beloved trio have created a record cinematic in scope that rides the crest of the new century with a beggar’s banquet of  spells, hollers, rapturous preaching, and of course, DADDY LONG LEGS stompin’ beat.

Miss World’s debut album manages to be astute, funny, acerbic, engaging and crucially is absolutely rammed with killer pop tunes; “a multi-coloured sonic mood board featuring torn up images of Ariel Pink, Kim Gordon, Clueless OOTDs, Madonna and Kim Kardashian smeared with gluestick goo.” Programming descriptions are generated by participants and do not necessarily reflect the opinions of SXSW.|30.263413|-97.727159

With songs like, “Daylight Savings,” on which the band asserts, “I wish every day was daylight savings/an extra hour of sunlight/ an extra hour to get high,” they are exactly how you’d expect them to be offstage; upbeat, hilarious, New England punks who’d like nothing more than to goof off and make music with their friends. However that impression partially collapses when they mount the stage, strap into their instruments, and reveal their sludge-coated surf riffs and drums that sound both wildly anarchic and assertively tight. GYMSHORTS has been fiercely touring the U.S for the past few years supporting acts such as La Luz, Tacocat, Ron Gallo, The Frights, Death Valley Girls, Hunny and Naked Giants.

They have been dubbed Psychedelic rock, proto-metal, doom, stoner metal, noise-punk, hard rock, and everything in between, but if you ask them it's ""rock and roll with psychedelic influences."" Their imagery and sound seem to fluctuate rapidly between a peaceful meditative eastern-tinged message of unity and all out warcry with an underlying message of love and peace-through-violence.  Driven by Thomas (TJ) Lemieux’s brooding aesthetic and signature psychedelic guitar character, DEATHCHANT echoes through the darker side of Proto-metal and hard rock. Reflections of past endeavors from TJ Lemieux, John Bolino, Colin Fahrner, and George Camacho (Roast, psychedelic speed freaks, high rise, Babylon) cascade into an immersive wall of noise-induced heavy metal mania, equal parts paranoia and transcendental harmony. These four create a sound that is loud, massive, and about as melodic as a sonic assault of this magnitude can be.  They resonate with wherever or whoever you are and deliver an excitingly raw and catchy brand of rock and roll.

Across the bridge from said shed, house parties rage until the early hours and beyond, while around the corner there’s a sky-high pile of trash that acts as a makeshift home for the local rat population. It’s here, amongst jam sessions that would last six-hours plus, that the wacky, sprawling sound of Psychedelic Porn Crumpets was born.   “It had a tin roof, so it was really nice when it rained,” reveals the band’s frontman and ringleader Jack McEwan – an idyllic image that’s quickly scrawled over when he recounts a tale of said roof tearing off in the wind one night. “I used to have to wake up at 3am and spray myself with bug spray,” he adds with a shrug. Composing songs on an old, out-of-tune piano, and hooking up projectors to their amps to beam warped imagery around the clapped-out barn, their wonky approach to music-making took root amongst the hay. “We got too many noise complaints,” he admits, revealing that they’ve since decamped to a seaside home where they can make as much racket as they please. “It got into fine territory, Programming descriptions are generated by participants and do not necessarily reflect the opinions of SXSW.|30.263413|-97.727159

Imagine the feeling of driving down the highway listening to Springsteen with a car full of friends; pair that with the comfort of lying in bed next to a bag of M&M peanuts watching Twin Peaks. Welcome to Sorry Girls. Easier – their new 7” / double single – presents a culmination in Sorry Girls’ sound. Equally steeped in lament and celebration, its two songs are driven by uplifting vocals and synth-heavy arrangements. Cruisin’ power pop that cries equally with joy and sorrow. All the pleasure and regret felt by a hypochondriac who can’t resist a good cigarette. Sorry Girls is a Montreal based duo consisting of Heather Foster Kirkpatrick and Dylan Konrad Obront. The two met in 2008 while studying at university, making joke songs on GarageBand together over pots of Kraft Dinner on the floor of their friend’s apartment. Though they didn’t collaborate on anything serious for many years, there was an immediate pull to create music together.

3943|Mar 15, 2019|615 Red River St. Austin, TX, EUA|MUNYA|10:40pm|10:00pm|Swan Dive Patio|Born in the small town of Saguenay in Quebec, Josie Boivin is the youngest of nine children. Classically trained as a pianist, Boivin discovered she could sing opera in high school, when she was overheard by a music teacher while jokingly imitating an opera singer. After spending her teens in the highly competitive opera world, she studied jazz at the University of Montreal before dropping out.  It wasn’t until September of 2017 that Boivin found her calling, when a friend invited her to play the legendary Pop Montreal festival. At that point, she only had one finished song. “I realized that this was my chance,” she says. “If I was ever going to make my own music, it was now. I quit my job and moved in with my sister, just so I could write all day.” After her sister would leave for work every day, Boivin set up her gear, transforming the kitchen into a recording studio, where she wrote and recorded, cleaning everything up before her sister got home at five. These recordings, coupled with a few in-studio days with Miles Dupire-Gagnon and Gabriel Lambert from Anemone, would eventually become her debut EP Programming descriptions are generated by participants and do not necessarily reflect the opinions of SXSW.|30.2671738|-97.736684

3945|Mar 15, 2019|615 Red River St. Austin, TX, EUA|Graham Van Pelt|11:40pm|11:00pm|Swan Dive Patio|“I’d like to be as un-mysterious as I possibly can,” Graham Van Pelt says. He’s about to release Time Travel, his first record in the four years since he moved from Montreal to Toronto, and he’s no longer Miracle Fortress, or Inside Touch, or any of the aliases he’s used to record over the years. He’s just Graham Van Pelt. With the perspective of leaving a longtime home, of watching old friends change and familiar places become unrecognizable, came a recommitment to an emotional honesty in Van Pelt’s songwriting. Time Travel’s eight songs are a tangle of friendships and feelings. Moving backwards and forwards in time, they occupy a space of elegant melancholy. Immersing himself in the work of house music legends like Larry Heard, Vincent Floyd and Maurizio and the fragile disco of Arthur Russell, along with contemporaries like Jessy Lanza and Kelly Lee Owens, Van Pelt built the album from the bottom up, rooting every track in the crude sequencer of the Roland SH-101 synth, a decades-old dance music totem. The result are melodies that are simple but affecting, anchored to deep, wandering basslines.

Complex Magazine listed TiKA as “One of the most prolific creatives in Toronto.”   TiKA’s debut album + short film will be released in spring of 2019. Aptly titled “Anywhere But Here,” it serves as a brilliant indication of her unique voice, as well as her distinctive resonance and personality as a developed artist. Completely produced by Redbull Montreal graduate, multi- instrumentalist & musical phenomenon Casey MQ, the album is an 80’s inspired synth pop sound. “No matter what I am going through, I always want to convey love + light in my music. My lyrics are dark because my reality has been dark. My sound stays in the light.

Les Louanges launched his first EP, Le Mercure, on his Bandcamp page in 2016. He added an extra track, Encéphaline (which won a SOCAN Songwriting Prize), then formally released the EP the following year. Finalist at the 2017 Francouvertes, the Montreal-based Lévis-native, embarks on a new path by exploring more chillwave, R&B and hip-hop sounds on his debut full-length 'La nuit est une panthère' which was released in September 2018. Les Louanges presented his 14 pieces at the Transmusicales of Rennes in France, where he was selected to perform in December 2018. His new album is a good mix of eclectic songs. It’s pop; it’s jazzy (the song Jupiter), with a perfectly balanced amount of R&B (Westcott), hip-hop (Tercel) and chillwave. Great contemporary composers as well as a new generation of forward thinking artists inspire his music. He cites Frank Ocean, Hiatus Kaiyote, BadBadNotGood and Robert Glasper as his main influences.Programming descriptions are generated by participants and do not necessarily reflect the opinions of SXSW.|30.2671738|-97.736684

Then, following the 2016 release of her debut album proper, Parma Violets, came a serendipitous SXSW performance that would ultimately lead to her signing with Canvasback and Hand in Hive. Her EP, The Moths of What I Want Will Eat Me In My Sleep went down with aplomb on either side of the Atlantic earlier this year. Lead single 'Plastic Skeletons' was debuted by NPR and has seen UK radio support across BBC Radio1 (Huw Stephens' Tune of the Week),6Music, and more. She recently recorded a session for Stephens at Maida Vale. 2018 also saw her taking slots at Latitude festival and The Great Escape and dates with Haley Heynderickx, Elbow and Belle and Sebastien. Her latest EP, Wisdom Teeth is quite possibly the most eclectic Jealous of the Birds set to date: from the raw energy that drives the angular ‘Blue Eyes’ to the dexterous, playful indie-pop of ‘New York Has a Lump in Her Throat’; the dream-like ‘Kosikelu’ and the widescreen majesty of Clementina.

Their story started in Limerick, Ireland. Singer/bassist Aoife Power, guitarist Niall Burns, and drummer Andrew Flood met for the first time as three teenagers after sneaking into Costello’s Tavern: the only bar in town that catered to their musical tastes. After bonding over cheap vodka and the sound of The Velvet Underground, they began playing music together and moved to London.  The bands’ influences feed into a lineage that boasts everyone from The Cranberries to The Pogues. The band acknowledge those great literary songwriters perhaps no more so when they covered ‘Fairytale of New York’ last Christmas, which was immediately reciprocated when Pogues frontman Shane McGowan was singing their praises and invited them to play at his 60th Birthday party.    Fusing that “immigrant song’” sensibility with their love of noise and melody, the group are transforming into a modern day answer to early Blondie or the Pixies. Huge shows alongside the likes of Nick Cave and Patti Smith came this summer. They’ve also supported the likes of Dream Wife, Declan McKenna, The Vaccines, Peace and Blossoms.

Halima’s latest single ""Do Better"" is an introspective ode to self-love with an upbeat hook that complements her soulful R&B voice; it’s a graduation from the artist’s slower last release, ""If Love was Green,"" that teased at the themes of this track.

At odds with the music of the age, compressed as it is to an inch beyond its death, Keenan’s music beguiles you in, his lyrics akin to half-remembered barroom wisdom, that, days later, suddenly makes epiphanic sense. His art remains in a constant state of flux, whether it be sung to an acoustic guitar, delicately played with the small string section currently known as The Organics – navigating the hitherto unexplored hinterland between Nick Drake and Seán Ó Riada - or unleashed with his raucous Unholy Ghosts.  Like Dylan, Bowie or Prince before him, Keenan is almost too prolific, songs tumbling from brain to pen. By the time you get to hear what he’s doing, he’s already somewhere else. This is soul music.

Their story started in Limerick, Ireland. Singer/bassist Aoife Power, guitarist Niall Burns, and drummer Andrew Flood met for the first time as three teenagers after sneaking into Costello’s Tavern: the only bar in town that catered to their musical tastes. After bonding over cheap vodka and the sound of The Velvet Underground, they began playing music together and moved to London.  The bands’ influences feed into a lineage that boasts everyone from The Cranberries to The Pogues. The band acknowledge those great literary songwriters perhaps no more so when they covered ‘Fairytale of New York’ last Christmas, which was immediately reciprocated when Pogues frontman Shane McGowan was singing their praises and invited them to play at his 60th Birthday party.    Fusing that “immigrant song’” sensibility with their love of noise and melody, the group are transforming into a modern day answer to early Blondie or the Pixies. Huge shows alongside the likes of Nick Cave and Patti Smith came this summer. They’ve also supported the likes of Dream Wife, Declan McKenna, The Vaccines, Peace and Blossoms.

Co-founder of independent label Soft Boy Records, Kojaque mixes sampling and jazz beats with dynamic, poetic lyrics, showcasing life as a modern Dubliner. An established film-maker and visual artist as well as a musician, Kojaque’s multi-media performances and projects are unlike anything else in Irish hip-hop; brutal, honest, and beautiful at once. With a vast range of work produced both independently and with Soft Boy Records, Kojaque’s influences range from MF DOOM to Stevie Wonder. Kojaque has worked with notable Irish producers such as JarJarJr, GAPTOOF, and Wastefellow, and his influence on Irish hip-hop is palpable. Having performed huge festival debuts at Electric Picnic, Longitude Festival and Metropolis Festival in Ireland in 2018, and a fully sold out debut Irish and UK tour which included Dublin Academy 1 and London’s Corsica Studios both selling out within a week of on-sale, its no lie that 2019 is going to be a breakthrough year for Kojaque.

Since moving to the Swedish capital at the age of twenty, he’s established himself as one of the key figures in the city’s indie rock underground; after starting out playing bass in the punk outfit Kilroy, he met the similarly prolific Martin Savage and joined his band, Martin Savage Gang, handling bass and backing vocals as the group toured across Europe and the United States. Working with Savage inspired Appel to step out front and centre himself, and in the summer of 2016, his new three-piece Lion’s Den released their self-titled debut album, one that had Appel on lead vocals and guitar and on which he penned the lyrics himself. Lion’s Den continued in the Appel tradition of tightly-wound guitars and sharp melodies, with a quickfire running time and lyrics that reflected on the world around him. All the while, though, he was working on something that would mark a break away from the musical identity he’s spent over a decade cultivating. Burning Bodies is Appel’s first solo album, pieced together over the course of five years and consisting primarily of love songs that pertain  Programming descriptions are generated by participants and do not necessarily reflect the opinions of SXSW.|30.26633|-97.7375726

Following the release of Pink Gum the band toured around Scandinavia and Europe, mixing headline tours with support slots for the likes of Chastity Belt, before retreating to their Stockholm studio to work on their second record. Endless Graffiti retains the band’s trademark sound while finding the quartet both expanding their sonic palette and upping their songwriting game, arriving at what is undoubtedly one of 2018’s strongest indie rock releases, released on October 26 to praise from The Line of Best Fit, KEXP, Highsnobiety, Hype Machine and more.

Miss World’s debut album manages to be astute, funny, acerbic, engaging and crucially is absolutely rammed with killer pop tunes; “a multi-coloured sonic mood board featuring torn up images of Ariel Pink, Kim Gordon, Clueless OOTDs, Madonna and Kim Kardashian smeared with gluestick goo.” Programming descriptions are generated by participants and do not necessarily reflect the opinions of SXSW.|30.26633|-97.7375726

In January 2018 she released her third EP This Is It which was followed by European tour dates and her debut US shows during SXSW 2018.

After a year of touring and unprecedented radio success for the album in their home country, OSOG set out to record new music, set to be released later this year.

There, in mountain towns like Galax, old-time American music continues to thrive, supported by a community of fiddlers, flat-pickers, and fans.  Wild Ponies pay tribute to that powerful music and rugged landscape with their most recent release Galax, a stripped-back album that nods to the band's history while still pushing forward. Doug and Telisha took some of their favorite musicians from Nashville (Fats Kaplin, Will Kimbrough, Neilson Hubbard and Audrey Spillman) and met up with revered Old-Time players from Galax, Virginia (Snake Smith, Kyle Dean Smith, and Kilby Spencer). Recorded in the shed behind Doug’s old family farm in the Appalachians (steps away from the site where Doug and Telisha were married), it returns Wild Ponies to their musical and geographic roots.

The band’s live shows are known for their raw energy and humor.  Some people remember them for smashing guitars on Stage at The Varsity Theater, while others remember stunts like their infiltration of the 2008 Republican Nation Convention where they serenaded ‘members of the Illuminati.’  “The band is a blitz of post-punk, guitar smashing, wreck the train Rock and Roll that has not been seen since the glory days of CBGB.

Their second album overall behind 2016’s Not Coming Back, the nine-track long-player harnesses spaciousness and heft alike and soars with melodic vibrancy in a way most acts simply can’t balance. Shades of Soundgarden and Queens of the Stone Age appear, but they’re just shades, and Sundrifter’s vision of heavy is their own, someplace between grunge, doom, psychedelia and classic heavy rock.  Sundrifter is comprised of guitarist/vocalist Craig Puera, bassist Paul Gaughran and drummer Patrick Queenan, and Visitations was engineered, mixed and mastered by Dan Schwartz at Futura Productions in Roslindale, Massachusetts. The space the record captures isn’t of the Hawkwind, pulsating rhythm variety, but instead one that oozes with planetary motion, one that rolls along a chaotic cosmic path, not at all afraid to smash one asteroid off another before crashing to the surface, which, as we all know, is how life began in the first place.

Over those dozen years, too, Irata has made its presence known in metal and hard rock circles throughout the Southeast and beyond. Now, and thanks to its growth from a trio to a four-piece with the addition of guitarist Owen Burd, Irata is evolving yet again. With Burd's talents on guitar, vocals and trumpet added to what had already felt like a complete equation, Ward notes, Irata is pushing itself to new vocal and instrumental heights. Accordingly, its upcoming LP Tower applies impressive musicianship and complex textures to increasingly approachable tunes that teeter between hard rock and prog-metal.

3999|Mar 15, 2019|401 W 2nd St. Austin, TX, EUA|Rod Melancon|8:40pm|8:00pm|Lamberts|Like the soundtrack to a movie that doesn’t yet exist, Rod Melancon’s Pinkville whips up a world filled with shellshocked war veterans, gun-wielding rock & rollers, and other down-on-their-luck characters, mixing cinematic details and electric guitars into its own version of greasy, gothic Americana. Pulling everything together is Melancon himself: a southern songwriter and storyteller rooted in the oral tradition of Cormac McCarthy and Larry Brown. His songs are dark and detailed, and his voice — which veers between a spoken-word delivery, a croon, and a rough-edged howl — is every bit as diverse as the material it delivers. Pinkville, his fourth release, makes plenty of room for that diversity. There are psychedelic soul songs, Rolling Stones-inspired rockers, tributes to icons like Freddy Fender and Tom Petty, and a cover of Bruce Springsteen’s “57 Channels (And Nothin’ On),” all captured in analog sound by co-producers Adrian Quesada and Will Walden.

For their powerful new album, ‘The Wanting,’ the band handed production duties over to acclaimed singer/songwriter Will Hoge, who helped them create their most ambitious, fully realized collection yet. Recorded in Nashville, TN, the record draws on many of the group’s traditional strengths—indelible melodies, infectious hooks, explosive performances—even as the making of it pushed them far outside their comfort zone and forced them to take an unprecedented, nearly year-long break from touring. The bands most recent single “I’ve Got a Feeling it Hurts,” is a stunning, sonic duet with former tour-mate, LIZ BRASHER.

Years spent honing her craft as a songwriter and performer had finally brought her to this point – she was about to head out on her first national tour. She had been opening for Nashville staples like Luke Bryan, Blake Shelton, Kellie Pickler, and Brothers Osborne, while also commanding her own residency at Nashville mainstay, Third & Lindsley. As a principle character on A&E’s reality show, Crazy Hearts, the world got its first glimpse into the life of the burgeoning country music starlet. But just as Amy’s music was beginning to connect, life got in the way. Her engagement was called off, her future plans dissolved, and the turmoil brewing in Amy’s personal life crept into her craft. “I learned the hard way that not everything is meant to be. Sometimes timing is everything. After the dust settled, I struggled to reconnect creatively. I was in a very different place, and honestly it was really tough,” Amy recalls. Her relationship went south, but instead of dwelling on what might have been, Amy picked herself up and headed West, on a new journey of personal and artistic growth.

Ondara grew up in Nairobi, Kenya, listening to American alt-rock and making up his own songs for as long as he can remember.

There he began making his way in the local music scene, continually writing songs about what he saw, felt and experienced in a place far different from home. From a stockpile he says is hundreds of songs deep, Ondara chose 11 for Tales of America.

No stranger to the music industry, Murcia cut his teeth as a songwriter-producer while attending college in New York City, penning songs for a diverse list of mainstream artists. One fateful feature on a top 40 radio hit catapulted him into what he describes as a nightmare of appeasing industry gatekeepers. Murcia signed a major label record deal soon after that single was released, but realized he was a commodity being molded into something he wasn’t— a corporate conception of a Latin pop star.  With El Mañana, Murcia reclaims his Latino identity on his own musical terms. He began writing songs for the project when he was battling cancer, having to undergo multiple surgeries before it finally went into remission. Around that time, Murcia put together a trio to bring the songs to life. He found comfort in looking toward the future, making the phrase “el mañana” his motto. Now his vision extends beyond the horizon.  Programming descriptions are generated by participants and do not necessarily reflect the opinions of SXSW.|30.2668465|-97.74372849999999

In stepped brother Tender Blom on backing vocals and guitar, Darek Mercks on bass and Gini Cameron on drums, with Pip herself fronting on guitar on vocals. Since, the band have played more than a hundred gigs, rising from small pubs to the european festival circuit with performances at Eurosonic Noorderslag and The Great Escape - as well as being asked by the likes of Surfer Blood, Franz Ferdinand and The Breeders to join them on their various European tours.    The band’s energetic live show quickly pricked the ears of press and radio - with Vice’s music channel hailing Pip as ‘ready to join the ranks of 2018’s rising guitar acts', and BBC 6 Music A-listing recent singles ‘I Think I’m In Love’ and ‘Pussycat’. The station’s DJs Marc Riley hailed the former as ‘perfect pop’ with Gideon Coe branding it ‘excellent’ and, elsewhere, on the UK’s most popular music station BBC Radio One, Pip Blom perf Programming descriptions are generated by participants and do not necessarily reflect the opinions of SXSW.|30.2678607|-97.74096999999999

Consisting of four cousins & their best friend, the group began playing live during their teenage years & took their band name from a plaque mounted outside their grandfather’s house, one they later found out referenced the Irish village his family had emigrated from. Much like the band’s music, their name possesses deep personal meaning while still retaining an air of evocative mystery, hinting at places they’ve never been but still somehow course through their veins. Australia’s in their blood, too, and Sydney will always be home, but after signing with Concord Records, the band took a leap of faith in early 2018 and moved to the US. One listen and you’re hooked, sucked into their rapturous world of angular guitars and hypnotizing grooves. With a sound this meticulous and infectious, it’s hard to believe that the band has only just released their debut album, but the album is only the tip of the iceberg from a group that’s doggedly determined to fulfill every bit of their seemingly limitless potential.

Look Together tackles themes of repairing relationships, shedding insecurities, and fresh starts, with vibrant guitar/synth lines layered under Gutierrez’s pop melodies. The impassioned 12-track LP began to form merely a week after the release of 2014’s 88 92, as Gutierrez and Swann’s decade-long romantic relationship dissolved. Healing proved to be difficult, as Wild Moccasins were charted for two years of extensive touring. Gutierrez and Swann would spend countless hours in a shared van, painfully staring each other down on stage and exchanging exaggerated he- said-she-said’s through songwriting. Gutierrez and Swann began their writing partnership roughly a year into their romantic relationship, in 2007. The group has undergone roster changes over the years, but currently exists with the addition of Avery Davis (drums). Their latest effort is highly pop-powered, with Ben H. Allen (Gnarls Barkley, Deerhunter, Animal Collective) at the production helm.

It brings the culmination of Christy’s influences and her experiences traveling the world.    Born in rural central Illinois, Christy Hays never really aspired to be a working songwriter. Hays grew up somewhat surrounded by music, her father, a luthier and guitar player showed her the major chords on her old Gibson. There was no pressure to play but music was a centerpiece.

While Royal Jelly (released in 2013) asserted the band as a member of the Austin rock scene, Heavy as the Sun emerges with a more shimmery pop aesthetic on intro tracks “Sake” and “Maybe It’s Over.” Songwriter/singer Sara Houser switches from guitar to keyboards (her primary instrument) to create a uniformly synth centered record. “I wanted the focus of this record to be more lyrically and melodically driven and for me those ideas come the most naturally when I’m playing piano,” explains Houser.  That being said, Heavy as the Sun doesn’t lack dynamics or the bombastic post rock moments that are more present in Löwin’s earlier releases. Amidst the glitz are songs like “Hard to Love” which starts off with heavy hitter Chris DeGeorge and Nate Ribner’s signature bass fuzz but then builds into a B52s inspired banger. Guitarist Michael Sanders shines on “Sloop” and “The Wheel” with tones reminiscent of Real Estate and Johnny Greenwood alike.  Heavy as the Sun was recorded in Austin, TX.

Lead single “Red Witch” reveals Taylor Wilkins (vocals, guitar), Clellan Hyatt (drums), Anthony Rucci (guitar), and Andrew Dalton (bass) reveling in the earworms of previous releases while assuming a newfound yet no less raucous approach to experimentation which permeates the record’s five tracks.   Make no mistake: the band’s love affair with fuzz is far from over. In fact, it’s rekindled riotously by flirtations with super-charged shoegaze (“Cool Evil Part 1”), forays into reverb-washed rollick recalling My Bloody Valentine’s wall-of-sound wallop (“Cool Evil Part 2”), and searing solos inspired by ‘90s titans like Smashing Pumpkins paired with Fugazi-inspired punk-rock punch (“Maybe I Don’t Like Drugs”).

Husband and wife duo Ryan Devlin and Kim West first met while slinging pies at a south Seattle restaurant in their early 20s. Devlin, a fixture in the Northwest’s thriving DIY rock scene, and West, an aspiring law student, started writing and recording songs in Devlin’s bedroom during a cash-strapped Christmas as their friendship blossomed into romance. Pulling from their mutual love of 70s rock, vintage synthesizers, thrift shop treasures, and early MTV, the pair’s bond permeated their pop songcraft. The duo,  joined by drummer Nick Krivchenia and bassist Luke Logan, create a stoney blend of Northwest rock & roll and razor-sharp disco grooves that Impose Magazine has called “a modern bit of AM radio gold.” The group released their first LP, Taste For Blood, in 2014 to regional acclaim and heavy airplay and support from iconic radio station KEXP. Catching the attention of upstart label Freakout Records, the band released their sophomore LP, Hot Candy, in 2016. 2018 saw the band releasing two EP's, ""Come to Terms"" and ""Different Windows,"" with supporting appearances at clubs and festivals across the United States and the UK.

Such was strength of those first initial ripples, that they rapidly became waves, and the band quickly found themselves playing a headline Club NME at London's KOKO, The Great Escape, Dot to Dot, Isle of Wight Festival, and Reading & Leeds amongst countless other well-received dates that continue to cement their reputation as one of the UK’s best loved touring bands. Not content with being on top of their live game alone however, the band’s DIY roots and inexhaustible work ethic recently caught the attention of the BBC, who commissioned a Newsbeat documentary charting their rise from back-street buskers to major radio darlings, while their self-funded debut 'Alive' made Record Store Day's Top 40 at the time of its release.

It was a year that saw Larkins grow and evolve into the sleek, well-oiled outfit that they are today. Latest single ‘Something Beautiful’ is the first taste of that maturing process to be released, and it bristles with a cocksure swagger that epitomises their new outlook perfectly. Produced by Chris Zane (Friendly Fires, Passion Pit), it eschews the button-bright indie-pop of previous releases (such as the fittingly titled ‘Sugar Sweet’) in favour of something darker and more refined. ‘Something Beautiful’ draws on the ubiquitous touch of the band’s soul and R’n’B influences, resulting in a single that’s both frenetic and funky, proving once again why Larkins are one of the most impressive and versatile bands doing the rounds at the moment. With a whole host more to come in 2018/19, Larkins' meteoric rise looks set to continue with the announcement of their biggest ever headline show at Manchester's Albert Hall and the announcement of the signing to Good Soldier Songs Programming descriptions are generated by participants and do not necessarily reflect the opinions of SXSW.|30.2656698|-97.7478443

In desperate need of a name to put their songs to online, they picked Anteros - the god of requited love, a landmark in London that united the scattered members in one place and, most importantly, the title of the song that cemented their retro-tinged indie pop sound.

Since their 2011 EP ​Holy Stain,​ the band have received accolades for their taut analyses of social ills and the resulting strain on body and mind, but even the skeletal no-wave that defined their early sound was bound with, in the broadest sense of the word, soul. The band’s ability to confront their deepest insecurities and doubts is more than simple catharsis, it serves to illuminate deeper questions of existence and identity, and frame them in context of systemic oppression, discrimination, and isolation.

A force that has deep conviction, purpose, and weight, songs are voiced through a lens of chopped up drum grooves, stark melodies, washed-out synth tones, and historic sample pulls. On their sophomore album, The Garner Poems, the group traffics their signature gritty strain of DIY Afrofuturist soul music, balancing hip-hop production techniques with lo-fi experimentation to create a sonic suite that eulogizes victims of police brutality, including Tamir Rice and Eric Garner, as well as bringing forth a conversation that aligns with the political and emotional state of this world.

Engineered and produced by Hoffman and perfected over the last year, the record broadcasts heavy feelings amid screech and feedback with little more than a fuzz pedal to clog up the signal chain.  For Sturino, writing in Weakened Friends is more of a physical process than a mental one.  “I have to feel the vibration or sound coming out of my body. I need the physicality to do it, to enjoy singing it,” she says. “People probably hear the vocals and think, ‘she just puts on that weird voice,’ but it’s really just what comes out. It’s my body making that sound.” Many of the songs reckon with deep mid-20s malaise — with the feeling of being young, stuck, and settling for less. “Sometimes, things look good on the outside, but they’re not working. That’s how it used to be for me. I’d hear, ‘You have a really cool job. You live in a cool city. Your band is cool.’ It was ‘Common Blah’ though because I was miserable. I didn’t care.

The music is modern and retro and optimistic and bleak and carefree and apocalyptic all at once."" Those juxtapositions lie at the heart of ‘Kiss Tomorrow Goodbye,’ Beverly’s thrilling debut LP under the Indianola moniker. Recorded at Shovels & Rope’s studio in Charleston, South Carolina, the collection stitches together a broad range of genres and eras, gleefully toying with decades of music history in order to create a sonic collage from an alternate timeline, one in which snarling garage rock guitars flare up alongside 60’s girl group melodies and greasers and punks party with velvet-voiced crooners. Beverly mines the past like a found footage artist, seizing on unexpected moments from long-forgotten productions in order to splice them together in a wholly new context. The result is utterly engrossing and infectious, a pop culture Frankenstein that sounds like Roy Orbison fronting The Sonics or Buddy Holly soundtracking a B horror flick.

For alt rockers Jocelyn & Chris Arndt, those ties are made of carbon fiber. “He’s my best friend,” says Jocelyn. “And to be able to chase this shared dream with my best friend, well, that’s everything.” The Arndt's unique combination of devastatingly powerful vocals, retro-infused guitar, and entrancing lyrics creates what's best described as an alternative-leaning throwback to pure, album rock. Press includes Baeble, Paste, Huff Post, Relix, Jam in The Van, and numerous others. Jocelyn, Chris, and their band perform hundreds of shows at legendary venues and festivals coast to coast. Their albums feature guests like G Love, Gov’t Mule’s Danny Louis, and Cory Wong of Vulfpeck. Their single ""Red Stops Traffic” cracked the Billboard Triple A Top 40 with radio airplay nationwide, while their album ""Go"" held the #2 position on The Jambands Top 30 Album Chart for 3 consecutive moths. Perhaps most amazingly, they’ve done all of this while balancing college at Harvard University. Come rock with them at SXSW!

Throughout his burgeoning career, the artist had attracted a fervent following and critical acclaim on the 2014 solo offering, Seventeen Acres, released under his legal name. In the years since, the music transformed into a blend of delicate dissonance, distorted slide guitar transmissions, sequenced beats, vinyl samples and warm electronics, culminating in the April debut of SONTALK: Act I EP on Sony Music Masterworks. Initially meant as an introduction to his full-length debut, the EP’s lead single “I Am a War Machine” garnered praise right out of the gate as Stereogum claimed, “LeMay sounds vulnerable, but the sunny thumping instrumentation delivers enough momentum to aid in a kind of soul-saving atonement.”As he took the project on the road, the track generated over a million streams within a few months.

Led by frontman Rich Russell’s never-ending call of the road, the group have toured extensively behind two acclaimed albums across continents on both sides of the world, while never straying too far from their “Cosmic Americana” roots. An ethereal reverence for the troubadour spirit is evident in stand out tracks “Western Style Saloons” - an homage to small town dance halls featured on the final season of Netflix’s Bloodline - and the linking of asphalt, mind and body in “Steel” - named KCRW’s Top Tune Download of the Day. Both appear on 2015’s Can’t Stand Still, which became more of a state of being than a sophomore album for the Heroes as the number of shows across the U.S. paired with an Australian tour turned into 100+ dates. Can’t Stand Still was praised at home by the Austin Chronicle as one of 2015’s best albums, featured abroad in Rolling Stone Australia, and received airplay on radio stations throughout the U.S., Europe and Australia.

We’re just as likely to get down on Simon & Garfunkel and Bob Dylan as we are Van Halen, and Kendrick Lamar. We love dogs, we love our van, we love playing together, and we love you - it's true. For the past few years, we’ve pretty much always been on tour, hitting the road on our own, with fellow bands, and have been lucky enough to open for a few heroes. From living rooms and basement clubs, to theaters and arenas, we just love playing shows, and being on the road. Our fans are our greatest priority - we love them, we really do, and we do our best to insure them that we can’t do this without them. Our message is one of acceptance, not in a circle sitting kum-baya bullshit way, but in a way of acknowledging that we all have shit we regret, we all have passions and opinions, and it's up to all of us to filter through our flaws and our regrets to find ourselves and love one another.

They have provided direct support for bands such as Twin Peaks, Ringo Deathstarr, and Temples, and just completed their third national tour.  The band is fronted by singer, guitarist and producer Jake Miles. Annie Long and Mary Bryce fortify the outfit with stunning vocal harmonies, and provide a spectacle at live shows with matching alien-esque attire and singular dance moves. Other members include Harrison Anderson on the bass and Everett Bergstedt on the drums. “Sunny dissonance, avant garde pop, and playful instrumentation inform SMiiLE’s warm sincerity,” says The Austin Chronicle. Instrumentally, SMiiLE is notably polyrhythmic and complex, but with a pop influenced buoyancy that satiates.  Following the release of their first full length album, ""Like A Diamond In The Rough, You Shine,"" the band united their following with a continually expanding repertoire of new songs.

If Bukowski was queer and wrote songs for Patti Smith, those songs might sound like this. Camped out in 1809 Studios, a literal stone’s throw from the Erie Canal, Seán and producer/studio owner Dave Drago set out to make a record, start to finish, in a few days, later adding a collaboration from Adam Duritz of the Counting Crows. Cissy is a measured, brutally observant deconstruction of masculinity, where the main players in the story – drag queens, mothers, queers, office workers, and wanderers – come together in the name of excess and anxiety. Barna plays both drums and guitar on Cissy, but it is his rare poetic bravado and stream-of-consciousness vocal delivery – theatrical and pained but grounded and honest – that guides us, shines a light on our traumas, and invites us in for a drink.

It’s the culmination of experience, both musical and rawly human, that makes Altameda the band they are. Hitting festival circuits and stages across Canada and the UK, they’ve toured extensively since releasing their much-celebrated debut album, Dirty Rain.  Full and resounding, cutting and dynamic, Altameda’s sophomore release, Time Hasn’t Changed You, is full of all that makes life a beautiful mess. Brought along by warm bass lines, bluesy rhythms and the sweet whir of the wurlitzer, vocalist Troy Snaterse’s lyrics burn with nostalgia and present desire, made vivid by his talk-like cadences and emotional peaks. It will lift you out of your seat—then all at once send you spiralling down to the kitchen floor. It’s love lost and gained and lost again. It will stay with you even after vinyl and needle have parted ways.

After writing thousands of measures of classical music, though, Harris found himself drawn back to the country, folk, and rock music that had soundtracked his early childhood. He'd grown up listening to classic crooners like Hank Williams, Roy Orbison, Jim Croce, Patsy Cline, and Elvis.  Harris began cutting his non-classical teeth with the Show Ponies, an Americana group based in L.A. He played guitar for the band and produced most of their albums, racking up several million Spotify streams along the way.  ""I love country music because it's built upon a collision of the sad and specific,"" says the songwriter, whose music evokes comparisons to imaginative Americana frontmen like Daniel Romano and Robert Ellis.

The band's follow-up release, The Native, arrives less than one year, doubling down on Vandoliers' modern approach to traditional influences. Rounded out by bassist Mark Moncrieff, drummer Guyton Sanders, fiddler Travis Curry, electric guitarist Dustin Fleming, and multi-instrumentalist Cory Graves, the group fills The Native's 10 songs with barreling guitar solos, train beats, anthemic melodies, mariachi horns, and the autobiographical details of Fleming's own travels.Programming descriptions are generated by participants and do not necessarily reflect the opinions of SXSW.|30.2504975|-97.74903359999999

Always passionate, at times profane, Sarah stalks/walks the line between vulnerable and menacing, her voice strong and uneasy, country classic but with contemporary, earthy tension. You can hear in her voice what’s she’s seen; world weary, lessons learned—or not—but always defiant. She level-steady means what she says. Writing with a blunt urgency—so refreshing these days it's almost startling—Sarah's lyrics are in turn smart, funny, mean, and above all, uncompromising. Sly turns of phrase so spot on they feel as old and true as a hymn. Anger that's as confrontational as it is concise. Humor that's as wry and resigned as a park bench prophet.  The Disarmers hit all the sweet spots from Nashville’s Lower Broad to Bakersfield and take Sarah's unflinching tales out for some late-night kicks. At times, it’s as simple and muscular as Luther Perkins’ boom-chicka-boom, or as downtown as Johnny Thunders. The Disarmers keep in the pocket, tight and tough.

They started at a time when it was deemed patently absurd to mix the two types of music, but the Wacos knew the score; they are different sides of the same coin, the personal wrapped in the political. And instead of travelling calculated creative boulevards during their career, the Waco Brothers have explored dark alleys and winding gravel paths through nine releases, all with the headlights off and the pedal to the metal, worrying (or not worrying) about end results later. With a body of work known for the indelicate and raucous, this may be their most deliberate and punchy yet—no one’s more dangerous than a man with nothing to lose.

The musicians that make up Dallas hip-hop group Cure for Paranoia have their own bold energy and personal styles which would best be described as aggressively funky. Between Tomahawk Jonez’s and JayAnalog’s production, Stanley Francisko’s airy vocals, and Cameron McCloud’s brisk lyrical delivery, the band has designed its own brand of “trippy soul-infused hip-hop.” The group formed when the four guys took a “doomsday road trip.” Following the advice of some conspiracy theorist friends, they packed up and headed to an ideal place to wait out the apocalypse. When an earth-shattering meteor didn’t hit, inspiration did. Having recently been diagnosed with bipolar paranoid schizophrenia, McCloud found clarity in making music with Analog, Jonez, and Francisko. By the time they returned home, the band was born.   In the following months, Cure for Paranoia quickly made a name for themselves and were awarded Dallas Observer’s Best New Act. They formed a relationship with Erykah Badu and began touring and recording.

Together, their music is a punchy, psych-tinged, lyrical variety of rock and soul. Los Coast formed like Voltron, and Trey happened to be the heart. He is Los Coast’s “Stax-worthy” vocal feature. To put it simply, “there’s something about Trey’s voice that resonates with you.” He was introduced first to jazz—by his uncle Hiram Bullock—but Trey’s musical enthusiasm embraces gospel, punk rock, folk, and hip-hop, among other genres, and his eclectic songwriting style reflects his catholic musical interests. John is a multi-instrumentalist primarily featured as lead guitar. John’s style is rooted in experimental rock and modal jazz and heavily influenced by an appreciation of music theory developed studying mood, texture, and composition at Berklee College of Music.

He returns to that place—both creatively and physically—with his latest album, Immortal Americans. Written after a tumultuous period that found Lucas getting sober, supporting his partner through a battle with cancer, and breaking up with his longtime record label, Immortal Americans is a clear-eyed album for murkier times, rooted in stripped-down heartland rock songs that find the artist reflecting upon the changes in both his hometown and himself. It’s also Lucas at his most honest, rooted in a string of largely unamplified anthems that don’t rely on electricity to pack a punch. “I was watching the changes in Bloomington and reflecting upon the changes in my own life,” he sums up.“ Not all of this is happy stuff, but there’s hope. There’s light in the darkness. I really do believe in second and third chances, because I know how many chances I’ve received. You have to keep fighting.""

Dickey’s acting debut in Blaze, Ethan Hawke’s biopic about doomed Texas singer-songwriter Blaze Foley, has already led to more roles, including their pairing as bounty hunters in The Kid, a western directed by Vincent D’Onofrio. But just as exciting, as far as Dickey’s concerned, is the opportunity it provided to record with that musical hero, longtime Bob Dylan guitarist Charlie Sexton (who played Blaze’s other troubled Texas songwriting legend, Townes Van Zandt). After they did the film’s original cast recording (on Light in the Attic Records), Sexton produced Dickey’s solo album, A Glimmer on the Outskirts.

Ask about him amongst musicians, whether they be internationally recognized artists or music students. Diego has always transcended Flamenco in his music. Not only a singer but also a prolific musical producer, arranger, composer and guitarist, Diego is one of the top references in the world when it comes to the fusion of Flamenco with other genres. The unusual story of this Andalusian native began with his studies in the conservatories of Seville, Granada and Cordoba. By day he worked on majoring in Composition and Orchestral Music, and by night, he immersed himself in the oral tradition of Flamenco, gathered around a fire with a guitar coupled with the characteristic sounds of the Palmas and Flamenco singing. This duality marked the birth of his daring proposal to bring Flamenco closer to other musical styles. His debut album, ""Vengo Caminando"", is an eclectic work rooted in Flamenco, yet tastefully opens doors into other styles of music. Nominated by prestigious Latin Grammy Awards in the category of ""Best Flamenco Album"". After 60 concerts in Spain in the last 12 months, he is now preparing his first US tour.Programming descriptions are generated by participants and do not necessarily reflect the opinions of SXSW."|30.2666157|-97.73962019999999

A celebratory effort ushering in a new era for the band, after having recently evolved from a sextet to a trio, “MCH: Part One” is about finding hope in transition, discovering your voice in a sea of doubt, and deciding to dance despite sadness. Since the departure of three founding band members in 2016, Run River North have fought to reclaim their identity and their sound. With that came a reckoning: The trio were steadfast on returning to their roots and rebranding again as Monsters Calling Home as a way to separate themselves from the personnel changes.“Having to go through three breakups, it was a shitty time,” Hwang says. “The EP song are more representative of how do you find hope and how do you find joy even if you have a right to feel angry.

VACATIONS show no signs of slowing down anytime soon. With more touring worldwide and new material on the horizon, it’s early days in this band’s career.

Their versatile sound, at times reminiscent of psychedelia, dream pop, and post-punk, demonstrates a dynamic range of songwriting prowess centered around consistently infectious, sun-soaked melodies and guitar hooks. HFHW formed in Davis, California as a noise pop collaboration between Adam Abildgaard and Nick Duffy in 2010 and added Ted Davis in the following years amidst a series of lineup changes. Renouncing the traditional front-manned format of most contemporary bands, the members instead each contribute songs and share the lead. Continuing their habit of self-reinvention, the band has generated growing excitement with a series of ambitious new singles from their forthcoming EP, Mood Ring, set to release on Feb 15 2019 via EMPIRE. The new material teases a dreamier, more psychedelic and indulgent sound, and has landed the group spots on Spotify playlists like POLLEN, Bedroom Pop, Modern Psychedelia, and All New Indie.

And if that objective at all seems like a long shot, outlets like Vice and Paste have already endorsed him as a maestro of the form.” - Erick Mertz, Bearded Magazine “Raybon's distinctive retro aesthetic seems 100% genuine, which begs the question - why is this Post-Millennial channeling 80's-era John Hughes soundtrack pop?” - Mike Olinger, Paste Magazine  “Not every teenager has to write music that sounds like what's charting on Billboard's Top 100"" - The Revue Programming descriptions are generated by participants and do not necessarily reflect the opinions of SXSW."|30.26629|-97.73750299999999

Hazey Eyes, is classically trained in a slew of instruments: from violin to piano to upright bass. But he was pushed onward by a musical family (his dad plays saxophone, clarinet and piano) eventually ending up being rated in the Top 5 players in his state.  Music began early for Hazey Eyes. As well as his work in the classical world, in high school he formed a heavy metal band. Though it’s a far cry from the subtle, relaxing sound he makes now, the name Hazey Eyes is a subtle nod to his heavier background – it’s taken from a lyric in the first chorus on Taking Back Sunday’s debut album. Though there are subtle nods to his electronic background in the music, Hazey Eyes sits in a place of his own – one of comforting reflection, somewhere between the hours when night time begins and the day ends, all compliment with strings hinting at his orchestral background.  Life can often throw curveballs, upending a once-pleasant situation and clouding it with darkness. In these times the music of Hazey Eyes is important: a way to feel less alone, to reconsider things, to even find a kind of h Programming descriptions are generated by participants and do not necessarily reflect the opinions of SXSW.|30.26629|-97.73750299999999

Performances vary from being steeped in tradition and bound to its constructs to more experimental fascinations with electronic and acoustic accompaniments, and introducing Butoh and Ritual Performance Art. Soriah’s use of Khöömei as a transportive medium is an offering to nature in her own tongue, that of organic sound whether it be wind, water or the mimicry of animals.  One becomes encased in an awe-laced ceremonial pallor while in attendance at a Soriah performance.

4228||401 Sabine St. Austin, TX, EUA|Sneaks|||Palm Door on Sabine|Just as she takes up space in the male-dominated Baltimore–Washington metropolitan area punk scene, Sneaks aka Eva Moolchan takes up space among the patriarchy. Highway Hypnosis, her forthcoming album on Merge Records that will drop in January, plays on hip-hop, post-punk, and invented words to fill a gap between the feminist underground and genre-specific singles charts. Through it, Moolchan joins the resistance forged by queer black feminists who create, explore, empower, conquer, and play bass. The solo act, born with Pluto in Scorpio, released her first single “Beliefs” in September. The glimmering anthem shrouded in an atmosphere of darkness drops its beat along with a call to arms for all non-believers whose mantra is assigned: “Remove your beliefs and start again / ’cause all I wanna do is start again.”  Flashes of Robyn, Britney Spears, Jock Jams, Nirvana, recess hour on the blacktop, M.I.A., Lil Mama, a hacky sack circle, Aaliyah, and your first Warped Tour experience somehow all make sense inside the mind attached to ears experiencing Highway Hypnosis.  Between responsibility, laughter samples, and charming vocals lies one club banger, your little sister’s anti-meat sc Programming descriptions are generated by participants and do not necessarily reflect the opinions of SXSW.|30.2645624|-97.7365355

Or about another bandmate deciding to go off on his own to find his “voice” and make a record that “matters”. Between the barrage of superlatives and unwarranted argument of how the debut album challenges any post-Beatles' solo work, folks just can’t help but doze off. Sure it could be the lack of sleep, self medicating or early onset dementia, but let’s be honest. We lack bandwidth for all the quality material thrown at us today. Oh we try to keep up, but how can we? I mean there’s 9 ‘Real Housewives’ reality shows concurrently running and American Idol just got picked up for season 17. And those priorities WILL NOT be compromised. So where does that leave us? If what you’ve read thus far hasn’t done it, just look at the pic over there. Doesn’t it make you wonder what those baby blues are stoically reading about? The weather, sports, a Grammy nod!? Nah, it’s probably just the demise of civilization as we know it crumbling into a sea of apathy. But not to worry, Rome didn’t fall in a day. There’s still plenty of time to ignore impending doom and enjoy the finer things in life...like this artist!

The album and their altogether expression is eclective, overwhelming and intimate and they top it off with a hint of pop music.

There are the bedroom dreamscapes, suspended between rousing from sleep and falling back into it; nightmarish tones that growl and distort; swells that expand and contract like the breaths of a resting lover; and a dreamy mountain twang that echoes beautifully in the ear. It’s all sowed with unabashedly honest lyrics that make Ballen’s music equal parts visceral, vulnerable, and resilient. “Her music evokes the the majestic beauty of the Pacific Northwest, an intense stillness broken up by the crashing of internal thoughts."" -Stereogum  “Whitney Ballen's songs are quiet in a way that both augments and disarms the very real (and earth-shattering) emotional wreckage therein.” - KEXP Programming descriptions are generated by participants and do not necessarily reflect the opinions of SXSW."|30.2645624|-97.7365355

It challenges conventions, knocking you on your ass with some glitchy electronics here or a blown-out scream there when you least expect it. It’s a captivating listen from the San Francisco-based artist, one that rewards multiple listens and a close reading of the lyric sheet.

She played every instrument on the record, including guitar, piano, drums, bass, cello, and glockenspiel.   The songs tell a meticulous and complex story, detailing the joy and despair following the inception and drawn-out end of various romantic connections and her division from Christianity. The songs all have one major thing in common: the commitment to honesty, often telling these stories exactly as they happened.

In the world she conjures within the album, there's plenty of room to forge your own home where you can rejuvenate and heal—where you don't have to be a superhero and you don't have to save the world all by yourself, where nothing is expected of you except that you just be. It's the kind of album you can curl into after a hot summer day in the city: a powerful talisman in a demanding world, and a reminder that kindness toward the self can help unlock the way to a world a little more livable than this one.

Three part harmonies and tight musical arrangements draw listeners in, only to be taken away by the classic style and lyrics that recall another time and place.

4244||401 Sabine St. Austin, TX, EUA|Booher|||Palm Door on Sabine|In a city where most of Austin’s lyrical depth is tied up in the postpunk and in the country scene (presumably), Austinite Michael Booher carves out a space of emotional literacy into a chronically indifferent scene, carving letters to a lost love like one would carve letters of fidelity into a playground tree. Pensive and uplifting, debut album Funny Tears is all the fist pumping good times of an all-American band steeped in the golden age of jagged catharsis –a continuation of the best days of storied alterna-something-something largely thought lost and not to be heard from again. Carrying on the hallowed ground where Replacements, Pavement, Springsteen, and the Afghan Whigs would pitch their tents for at least an evening, Funny Tears is satisfyingly tangled up in a man often at odds with himself, yet welcoming, warm and universal enough to pull in the most unlikely visitor. Or to pull up an old friend out of the dumps and tell them there’s always a way. Booher’s songs written from a rollercoaster are all his own –the view from the top is thrilling, and the plummet into the uncertainty that grips us all is inspired and tugs more than a little on the heartstrings.

Released on January 8, 2016 via Holy Mountain Sounds, RIVAL gathers the most vulnerable details of their crossroads and recounts their experiences in a manner that provides an openness and honesty that most artists never approach. Making an indelible mark on their hometown, Austin American-Statesman proclaimed, “Alternative-country has largely blended into the broader Americana landscape in recent years, but here’s a band that harkens back to the dead-center focus of the genre.” Not to be outdone, Austin Chronicle adds, “Harvest Thieves… comes from the Jackson Browne school of alt-country, where durable melodies and chunky guitars abound… demonstrating roots and smarts.” ​ Premiering first as a track on The Boot and its video on The Bluegrass Situation, the anthemic first single “Bob Dylan’s 78th Hangover” touches on the benders and cros Programming descriptions are generated by participants and do not necessarily reflect the opinions of SXSW.|30.2645624|-97.7365355

Balancing his Business Marketing studies at Louisiana’s Grambling State University with perfecting his craft, Dre, born Andre Davis Jr., joined forces with Houston's DJ Mr. Rogers in 2011 to debut his first solo project, “BLCK Diamond”. Dre immediately got to work on his sophomore mixtape, “BLCK Dreams”, which included fan favorites, “Ass Parade” and “Smoke In My Car.” Later that year Andre made the difficult decision to pursue his dream full time and dropped out of college.

Raised in New York City by their classically trained parents, siblings Daniel, David and Julia Bailen (fraternal twins and younger sister, respectively) immersed themselves in a record collection that included Simon & Garfunkel, Joni Mitchell, Carole King and The Band.  Even though they finish each other’s sentences, dissolve into laughter and tell hilarious contradicting childhood stories, BAILEN’s highly collaborative songs and visceral harmonies are formed by three very different individuals. They’re inspired not only by literature and a love of language, but also a myriad of classical and pop influences. Their musician parents didn’t push their kids. “They never said, ‘Guys, music is a viable option for a career,’” Julia explains. “I think they just showed us what the life of a musician was by example.” David affirms, “They normalized it.” Programming descriptions are generated by participants and do not necessarily reflect the opinions of SXSW.|30.26536399999999|-97.7472739

Throughout his burgeoning career, the artist had attracted a fervent following and critical acclaim on the 2014 solo offering, Seventeen Acres, released under his legal name. In the years since, the music transformed into a blend of delicate dissonance, distorted slide guitar transmissions, sequenced beats, vinyl samples and warm electronics, culminating in the April debut of SONTALK: Act I EP on Sony Music Masterworks. Initially meant as an introduction to his full-length debut, the EP’s lead single “I Am a War Machine” garnered praise right out of the gate as Stereogum claimed, “LeMay sounds vulnerable, but the sunny thumping instrumentation delivers enough momentum to aid in a kind of soul-saving atonement.”As he took the project on the road, the track generated over a million streams within a few months.

Whether it’s The Beach Boys, Bee Gees or First Aid Kit, that sibling vocal blend is the secret sauce in some of the most spine-tingling moments in popular music. The Cactus Blossoms – Minneapolis-based brothers Page Burkum and Jack Torrey – offer compelling evidence that this tradition is alive and well, with a deceptively unadorned musical approach that offers “creative turns of phrase, gorgeous harmonies, and an ageless sound” (NPR All Things Considered), not to mention spine tingles aplenty. Their 2016 debut You’re Dreaming, a stunning and transporting collection of original songs, earned high praise from Rolling Stone and Vice Noisey, tour stints with Kacey Musgraves and Lucius, and a perfectly cast performance on the third season of David Lynch’s Twin Peaks. Now their unlikely rise continues with new album Easy Way, to be released on their own label Walkie Talkie Records. While many bands would have been content to stick with the winning formula of their debut, the Blossoms refused to repeat themselves. If You’re Dreaming celebrated their vintage country and rock influences, Easy Way reveals a songwriting style that has changed, evolved, and gotten more modern.

Though vitally settled in the city that bled rap music, a new path would take shape that would soon define his career. That path was songwriting. Though ingrained in his DNA through countless years of artistry, surrendering the pen to the needs of other artists was uncharted territory. This soon led to his departure from the city that represented what seemed like his lifelong dream to the city that sculpts, chisels and molds it. While opportunity was deep-seated in the concrete arms of the rigorous goliath, New York tested Shirazee’s resilience. Overcoming homelessness he soon signed his first publishing deal and found himself at the helm of songs by artists like Sting, Afrojack, Ty Dolla $ign, and more. Fast forward to 2018 and encompassing experience, influence and his widespread musical pallet, Shirazee releases “MAKE WILD”, a feel-great tune that calls for intentness in what has always been his foreordained playground.

His sound has constantly been expanding and evolving since; twisted yet nuanced autotuned voices float on top of dark, angelic beats with an abundance of bass, lethal melodies and broken down rhythms as proven on standout solo album “Eversince”, released in 2016. Bladee unveiled his second studio album ”Red Light” in early 2018, a release followed up by a sold-out show at O2 Academy Islington in London plus him taking the helm as creative director for Yung Lean ́s Sadboys Gear brand shorty thereafter.

4327||610 E 6th St. Austin, TX, EUA|Merely|||The Main|In ancient stories, fairy tales and mythology, different tropes are often used to symbolise the powers found within all of us; for example, The King and Queen represents internal struggle and justice, and The Warrior represents courage and willpower. On the other hand, The Wizard is more ambiguous and represents the esoteric sides of the human psyche - insight, spiritual growth, a kind of messenger between worlds.  If Merely’s first two albums “Nirvana” and “Uncanny Valley” were her manifestations of The Warrior and The Queen, “Hatching The Egg” is The Wizard - a new incarnation, imagining her as the lead singer in a super group composed of the best renderings of her past self, all disguised as fable animals and creatures from the other side; an album painted with a palette of psychedelic, dreamy pop, shoegaze, chamber music and subtle hints of progressive rock.  Programming descriptions are generated by participants and do not necessarily reflect the opinions of SXSW.|30.2665517|-97.73659909999999
4328||610 E 6th St. Austin, TX, EUA|Nadia Tehran|||The Main|Growing up in a Muslim Iranian family in a small Christian town in the middle of Sweden, Nadia Tehran was seemingly destined to explore the limits and boundaries of personal and political identity - right in the gap between systems and beliefs, belonging nowhere and everywhere equally. Coming up through rap from a foray in punk with a modus operandi of “I Am What I Do, And I Do What I Want”, her work is a simultaneously supercharged and burnt out display of anti-authoritarianism, endless highs and chaotic heartbreak; a thorny yet ecstatic experience on unoccupied territory. Nadia´s battle-ready juxtaposition of DIY pop, frantic electronics and enthralling, fragile melodies is a mixture of musical nuances that inevitably reflects the approach that she’d rather raise her voice than lower it.

Posted up in the outskirts of Bangkok, Thaiboy was hard at work and quickly released the ’Lord of The Jewels’ mixtape, followed by standalone single releases produced by GUD, Palmistry and DJ Kenn. Then, in late 2016, the bladee collaborative album ’AvP’ dropped - clearly marking that through all the trials and tribulations, Thaiboy had continued to grow, constantly looking to evolve and find new ways of expression in order to escape this daily struggles. On his latest release ’S.O.S’ EP he emerged re-energised and re-invented, effortlessly floating across the rapping/singing border and back.

The bass line ferociously drives the car and the drums make sure you stay on the road - this is one of those trips where you sporadically wake up and find yourself in strange situations, wondering how the f*ck you got there. From the Shrimp shack to the dog show, one minute you’re playing rugby ball the next moment you’re being eaten by worms, and between the fading lights and the strange look on your friend’s face Murphy grabs your ears and asks you what it really is you want from this life. This is an album about illusions of realness, the absurdum of existence and the joke on humanity. ‘Street Worms’ is Viagra Boys debut studio album, a debut that instantly let them occupy their absolute own space in music history. “It was all a dream, but it was so nice. I had a nice house and such a lovely wife. We had a little dog, such a little dog, it reminded me of a large dog.

Still merely 22 years of age, his tale is as unassuming as it is wildly exploratory, a contradictory narrative about a misfit stranger from nowhere who, together with his friends and producers GUD and Yung Sherman, became a worldwide phenomenon almost overnight ­ a protracted and at times grievous metamorphosis from pubertal, post­internet novelty to D.I.Y icon with an extensive, organic influence over anything and everything from off­beat art projects and mainstream culture alike.

Though she is incurably independent, her sound exposes her many influences. From Stevie Wonder and Ella Fitzgerald to Blake Mills, Sigur Ros, and Solange. Most recently, she has had the pleasure of performing with and learning from Wyclef Jean. Her jazz-infused, neo soul songs are the product of this varied musical education. As a songwriter, Moira finds her confidence in self-deprecation and biting honesty. Her lyrics are loose-lipped explorations into the uncomfortable. She frequently exposes secrets in her songs that would otherwise be guarded by sobriety. Her constant need to unsettle is carried through her artistry, and, intentional or not, she never gives the same performance twice.

If their profile is rising now, it’s at the best possible time.  The result of a dream made manifest, El Castillo (out July 20th, 2018) serves as the band’s debut LP, part stylistic rebirth and part distillation of every quirk and feature that has made Honyock distinctly appealing since they first appeared. Produced by Father John Misty's David Vandervelde, it features the band's nimble songwriting with a playful pop sensibility, allowed to breathe in the loose-feeling structures of ballads and power-pop suites, imbued with the fractured grandeur of ‘70s guitar rock and glazed with the clean shimmer of ‘60s optimism, though it’s not without a minor touch of wistfulness to make the melodies bittersweet. Honyock regularly dips into serious territory while avoiding the theatrical pitfalls that can derail truly thoughtful handling of the subjects covered. They’re a group that can use artifice without becoming a background to it.

In the four years since forming, Oh, Rose has toured the US four times, and provided support for both Future Islands and Reptar on the west coast. Their most recent release, Seven, garnered write-ups in Gold Flake Paint, Portland Mercury and Bandcamp Daily while their debut EP, That Do Now See, was praised in blogs The Needle Drop and Nerdist.  Their new album, While My Father Sleeps, will be out in 2019. Programming descriptions are generated by participants and do not necessarily reflect the opinions of SXSW.|30.2678099|-97.7406942
4343|Mar 16, 2019|214C E 6th St. Austin, TX, EUA|Gabriella Cohen|11:40pm|11:00pm|Parish|In the summer of 2017, Gabriella Cohen moved to a farm in countryside Victoria, Australia, to record and self-produce her second album with engineer and partner-in-crime, Kate ‘Babyshakes’ Dillon. There, amidst flocks of screeching white cockatoos and herds of Black Angus cows, they etched the beginning of Pink Is The Colour Of Unconditional Love. Armed with a microphone and an interface, Dillon and Cohen captured the final touches of the album on a boat in England, and the coast of Portugal; in the mountains of Southern Italy, cafes of Mexico, and finally in Venice Beach, CA. Pink Is The Colour has materialised as an expansive and exciting body of work, showcasing Cohen’s unusually refreshing twists on pop arrangements. Throughout the new album Cohen (flanked by a choir of imaginary dolls that exist in her head) creates complex and sugary backing vocals. These signature vocal arrangements—contoured with classic harmonies and nostalgic melodies—form songs remarkable in their originality.  It’s an epitaph of electric wonder, and a definitive fact: Pink is the Colour of Unconditional Love.

4344|Mar 16, 2019|214C E 6th St. Austin, TX, EUA|Cayucas|12:40am|12:00am|Parish|Cayucas, the Los Angeles-based band known for their sunny, melodic surf rock and buoyant, rhythmic jams, know the value of a fresh start. After riding the wave that a pair of albums and half a decade in the indie rock spotlight brings, the group—the work of twin brothers Zach and Ben Yudin—found themselves facing an uncertain future after losing key parts of their infrastructure. Seizing upon the opportunity to make a change, they responded by injecting a new vibe into their bread and butter sound, resulting in no less than the album of their career. Having burst upon the scene in 2012 with their debut, Bigfoot, Cayucas quickly earned all the spoils for which a celebrated indie upstart could hope. Following two and a half years of heavy touring, they released their second album, Dancing at the Blue Lagoon, in 2015, a slightly moodier but no less infectious affair. It represented a creative step forward for the band, and while its level of praise never quite equaled the fever pitch for their debut, fans enjoyed the Yudin’s growth as songwriters and the record’s emotional depth. As they took time to begin preparations for the next record, they were also faced with the task of finding Programming descriptions are generated by participants and do not necessarily reflect the opinions of SXSW.|30.2678099|-97.7406942
4345|Mar 16, 2019|214C E 6th St. Austin, TX, EUA|BRONCHO|1:50am|1:00am|Parish|From their home base in the Heartland, Tulsa, Oklahoma’s BRONCHO have a unique vantage point from which to survey the sins. Churning out thoughtful, nuanced rock and roll with an art school spirit and a punk rock heart since 2010, the band’s fourth album, Bad Behavior, finds them leaning into their strengths for their strongest effort yet. Following the catchy, playful vibe of previous albums Can’t Get Past the Lips (2011) and Just Enough Hip to Be Woman (2014), as well as the deliberate sonic intent of 2016’s sludgy, moodier art piece Double Vanity, the new record reveals BRONCHO’s fly-on-the-crumbling-wall vision of our moral climate, complete with a reenergized, accessible sound and the charmingly sardonic, smiling-while-sneering delivery of singer and bandleader Ryan Lindsey.

Using my love for music, attention to detail, and imagination, I’ve been able to create a rhythm that tells a story. Originally from San Francisco, I was raised in a Christian/Catholic household& was a firm believer, until something very big shook my faith. I was sexually abused by my father at 8 years old. After my abuse, I was silenced for 15 years by the church and my family. As a little girl, who’s father was a deacon, and primary spiritual example, my belief system crumbled under his sickness. I was left broken. Lack of support left me isolated and alone. I came to Los Angeles, hoping to pursue music, and find the courage to share my story. I moved to city of 7 million a victim, and became an advocate. Programming descriptions are generated by participants and do not necessarily reflect the opinions of SXSW.|30.2710358|-97.714897
