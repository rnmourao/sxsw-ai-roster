While dependence on connected technology has grown faster than our ability to secure it, friendly hackers improve public safety, public policy, and save lives - through security research. Yet media portrayals of hackers lack authenticity and fidelity, focused on harmful behavior and motivations, instead of diverse narratives in the real hacker community. Hacking is a superpower: for good or for ill. Better media role models will create the hacker heroes we need. Real world hackers team with fictional counterparts to examine hacker roles in society vs media. The audience will understand who hackers really are, who they can be, and what drives them - and will distinguish myth from reality.Programming descriptions are generated by participants and do not necessarily reflect the opinions of SXSW.|60

It sounds easy: just pick a number and improve it. However, actually choosing a metric is an exploration of a many-dimensional space with no map and no guide. Until now. Learn how to choose the right metrics so you can build a better product and a better business. In the 13 years of Indeed’s existence, the company’s strategy has evolved considerably. What has remained constant is a dedication to making decisions based on evidence. Sometimes Indeed chose metrics wisely; sometimes Indeed chose metrics poorly. From these experiences, Ketan has derived a body of knowledge and a set of principles that can help others find the best metrics for their products and businesses.
