1731|How Beneficent Intention Can Help Eradicate Violence||0.365|0.0|0|Westin Austin Downtown Paramount 1|310 E 5th ST.

In today’s interconnected world, reasons to experience fear are easily found with just a click of one’s remote, phone, or computer. Our perceptions of fear and threat from the mundane (“What! Who finished my ice cream!?”), to the life-threatening, are hard-wired defense responses, and are often involuntary, unconscious reactions.  In this fun and interactive aikido workshop, “Aiki Lab,” you will explore exercises that reveal your natural defenses, as well as offer embodiment skills for confidence-building, improved communication, and transcendence of fear.  Experience how utilizing ""beneficent intention"" can help overcome natural fear responses and create a peaceful outcome even in the face of unexpected fear/violence. Real real-life examples such as an individual who stopped a school shooting before it occurred will be discussed. Utilizing 30+ years of study and Aikido principals as taught by Morihei Ueshiba, Sensei Quakenbush discusses how peaceful communication practices and conflict resolution technologies like Aiki-Lab are imperative (both in daily life and globally) for human societies to survive, thrive, and evolve.

Austin, TX, EUA|8|12:30:00|13:30:00|30.2620456|-97.7381328|We hear new breakthroughs in AI & tech everyday.  In the last few years alone we’ve heard about machines winning video games and even reaching human parity for speech, reading, object recognition, and translation in controlled tests.  But while we are excited about these advancements, we seldom hear about how we really got here and where do we think we can really go over the next few years. This panel will draw from experts who will share some of the untold stories of building assistants, personas, & AI.  What we learned from people in surprising places like Rap Battles in Central China, Favelas in Brazil, & hackers around the world. The cool ideas and the prototypes that didn’t work at all but did so in surprising, insightful and exciting ways that help us chart where AI will go next.

The intersection of physical and digital products is exploding with opportunities, and designers today are expected to think beyond the screen to build rich experiences. One way to achieve this is by creating prototypes with both physical and digital interactions.  This workshop will introduce designers to prototyping for the Internet of Things (IoT) using Arduino, an open-source electronics platform. Kathryn will walk through examples of multi-modal prototyping from low to high fidelity, sharing her physical examples in person and digging into the research insights discovered through testing them. Attendees will then get their hands dirty by building their own circuit, with provided Arduinos, and learn just how easy it is to create interesting interactions with a few lines of code.

Using story to communicate your brand can sometimes resemble guess work more than an intentional craft. When it comes to brand building, we’ll often overcompensate with trendy graphics and fancy drone shots to hope that maybe our audience will forget that the substance is lacking. Understanding the science behind brand-building storytelling can change that. In this workshop, we'll dive deeper into the psychology of story and how to use it to drive action from your audience. We'll then put the theory to practice by breaking out into smaller groups and teaching story structure.  This process has been taught to diplomats at the United Nations, crowds at Tedx and teams at Apple to empower more intentional brand decisions that drive results.

When designing in a bubble isn't an option, we need to cultivate a vulnerable work environment to build trust and align around common goals. In this workshop, you'll gain tools to empower your team to take ownership of its culture. Come learn to assess cultural health, identify ingrained patterns, and strategize better ways to work together.

In 2018 we experienced the same ""crypto winter"" as a few year prior, when Bitcoin tanked from 1200 to 250 Usd. Back then, the ""next killer blockchain app""  Ethereum as a decentralized computer with its smart contracts pulled the entire ecosystem out of a slump. Now in 2019 we are asking, which will be the next killer application on the blockchain, that could get the same done. We hear about candidates such as security tokens, stable coins and IOT. Internationally renown Blockchain expert Dr. Julian Hosp will dig deeper, clean up with myths and show, that probably none of these will bring the needed innovation. His candidate?
