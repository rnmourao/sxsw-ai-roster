It sounds easy: just pick a number and improve it. However, actually choosing a metric is an exploration of a many-dimensional space with no map and no guide. Until now. Learn how to choose the right metrics so you can build a better product and a better business. In the 13 years of Indeed’s existence, the company’s strategy has evolved considerably. What has remained constant is a dedication to making decisions based on evidence. Sometimes Indeed chose metrics wisely; sometimes Indeed chose metrics poorly. From these experiences, Ketan has derived a body of knowledge and a set of principles that can help others find the best metrics for their products and businesses.

In today’s interconnected world, reasons to experience fear are easily found with just a click of one’s remote, phone, or computer. Our perceptions of fear and threat from the mundane (“What! Who finished my ice cream!?”), to the life-threatening, are hard-wired defense responses, and are often involuntary, unconscious reactions.  In this fun and interactive aikido workshop, “Aiki Lab,” you will explore exercises that reveal your natural defenses, as well as offer embodiment skills for confidence-building, improved communication, and transcendence of fear.  Experience how utilizing ""beneficent intention"" can help overcome natural fear responses and create a peaceful outcome even in the face of unexpected fear/violence. Real real-life examples such as an individual who stopped a school shooting before it occurred will be discussed. Utilizing 30+ years of study and Aikido principals as taught by Morihei Ueshiba, Sensei Quakenbush discusses how peaceful communication practices and conflict resolution technologies like Aiki-Lab are imperative (both in daily life and globally) for human societies to survive, thrive, and evolve.

While dependence on connected technology has grown faster than our ability to secure it, friendly hackers improve public safety, public policy, and save lives - through security research. Yet media portrayals of hackers lack authenticity and fidelity, focused on harmful behavior and motivations, instead of diverse narratives in the real hacker community. Hacking is a superpower: for good or for ill. Better media role models will create the hacker heroes we need. Real world hackers team with fictional counterparts to examine hacker roles in society vs media.

In this panel conversation, experts in A.I. will dive one layer deeper into the technology in order to differentiate between the two primary types in our lives – Passive A.I. and Active A.I.

In 2018 we experienced the same ""crypto winter"" as a few year prior, when Bitcoin tanked from 1200 to 250 Usd. Back then, the ""next killer blockchain app""  Ethereum as a decentralized computer with its smart contracts pulled the entire ecosystem out of a slump. Now in 2019 we are asking, which will be the next killer application on the blockchain, that could get the same done. We hear about candidates such as security tokens, stable coins and IOT. Internationally renown Blockchain expert Dr. Julian Hosp will dig deeper, clean up with myths and show, that probably none of these will bring the needed innovation. His candidate?

Combustion. Plasma. Hear why scientists are sending experiments into low earth orbit and what we learn from conducting research in the microgravity environment aboard the International Space Station (ISS). The most basic phenomena on Earth can change 250 miles above its surface. Even cells can grow differently in microgravity, potentially allowing researchers to figure out ways to bioengineer replacement body parts for Earth-dwellers. Research experiments aboard the ISS promise to advance future crewed space exploration, enhance our understanding of life on Earth and may one day help us treat ailments and preserve fragile ecosystems.Programming descriptions are generated by participants and do not necessarily reflect the opinions of SXSW.|60
